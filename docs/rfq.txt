Project Title: Transfer of PICES Metadata Records to a Zenodo Community Collection
Background
The North Pacific Marine Science Organization (PICES) maintains a metadata catalogue that documents scientific datasets and research activities. The previous metadata catalogue, hosted in a Geonetwork-based system, is no longer accessible. However, a backup of metadata records exists in FGDC XML format, stored in Google Drive.
The objective of this project is to transfer these metadata records into a new metadata catalogue, which will be implemented as a Zenodo Community Collection(https://zenodo.org/communities/pices/records).
Objective
The selected contractor will be responsible for transforming, validating, and migrating metadata records to ensure compliance with Zenodo’s metadata schema. This includes:
Parsing existing FGDC XML metadata.
Mapping fields to Zenodo’s schema.
Performing necessary transformations.
Bulk uploading records to the Zenodo repository.
Identifying and recovering missing or unarchived metadata records by engaging with PICES Expert Group Leads.
Alternative Approaches Considered
Several approaches were assessed to determine the most efficient and reliable way to migrate metadata records to the Zenodo platform:
Manual Entry Approach: Each record would be manually entered into Zenodo. This was deemed impractical due to the high number of records (~4,206) and the risk of transcription errors.
Automated Bulk Processing with API Integration: This approach involves programmatically transforming FGDC XML metadata into Zenodo’s required schema and automating uploads via Zenodo’s API. This is the preferred method for its efficiency and scalability.
Hybrid Approach (Manual Validation + Automation): A combination of automated transformation followed by manual validation before upload. This ensures data quality while maintaining efficiency.
The contractor is welcome to propose alternative approaches that meet the project’s objectives while ensuring metadata integrity and compliance with Zenodo’s schema.
Scope of Work
The project will be executed in three distinct phases:
Phase 1: Metadata Extraction and Transformation
Review FGDC XML metadata schema.
Develop and implement code to parse and extract metadata from FGDC XML files.
Handle variations and edge cases in XML structure.
Analyze the metadata schema of the new catalogue.
Create a mapping template script from FGDC to Zenodo’s schema
Create a mapping template script from Zenodo’s schema to valid schema.org markup used by the Ocean Info Hub’s Ocean Data Information System (ODIS)
Phase 2: Bulk Processing and Upload to Zenodo
Automate the processing and transformation of 4,206 metadata records from FGDC XML format to Zenodo’s schema.
Implement error handling, logging, and testing procedures.
Write and test code to interact with Zenodo’s API.
Handle authentication, upload processes, and error responses.
Conduct test uploads and finalize the process.
Phase 3: Transform Zenodo Records to Ocean Info Hub Ocean Data Information System schema.org markup
Pull records from Zenodo using API into PICES GitHub Repo
Transform Zenodo to valid schema.org markup and host on GitHub Pages
Coordinate with Ocean Data Information System developers to ensure that schema.org records can be harvested by Ocean Info Hub
Automate updating of GitHub Pages with updated records
Phase 4: Stakeholder Engagement and Missing Records Integration
Review and assess recently entered records not included in the archived backup.
Identify and fill gaps in metadata through direct engagement with stakeholders (e.g., PICES Expert Group Leads).
Develop a process for integrating missing records into the new catalogue.
Conduct validation checks and finalize metadata records in consultation with stakeholders.
Expected Deliverables
Transformed and validated metadata records published to the PICES Community on Zenodo.
A documented mapping strategy detailing how FGDC metadata fields align with Zenodo’s schema.
A summary report identifying challenges, missing metadata records, and engagement outcomes with stakeholders.
Timeframe
The estimated timeline may vary depending on metadata complexities and stakeholder engagement requirements. A phased approach will be followed, with iterative testing and validation at each stage.
Submission Requirements
Interested contractors should submit a detailed quote including:
Experience with metadata transformation and integration.
Proposed methodology (especially if deviating from the outlined approach).
Estimated time commitment and cost for each phase.
References or examples of similar work.
Submission Deadline
Responses should be submitted to secretariat@pices.int as soon as possible. Shortlisted candidates may be invited for further discussion.
