  "name": "The Amphipod Superfamily Phoxocephaloidea on the Pacific Coast of North America. Family Phoxocephalidae. Part 2. Subfamilies Pontharpiniinae,  Parharpiniinae, Brolginae, Phoxocephalinae, and Harpiniinae. Systematics and Distributional Ecology",
  "description": "The systematics and distributional ecology of component members of phoxocephalidean amphipod subfamilies Parharpiniinae, Pontharpiniinae, Brolginae, Phoxocephalinae, and Harpiniinae in coastal waters of the Pacific coast of North America, from the Bering Sea to northern California, are analyzed. Of the 22 regional species here recorded, the 11 species (50%) are new to science: Pontharpiniinae: Mandibulophoxus mayi, new species; M. alaskensis, new species; Brolginae: Paraphoxus rugosus new species, P. pacificus, new species, P. communis, new species, P. gracilis, new species, and P. similis, new species; Phoxocephalinae: Parametaphoxus quaylei, new species; Harpiniinae: Pseudharpinia inexpectata, new species; Heterophoxus conlanae, new species, and H. ellisi, new species. Biogeographically, the subfamilies Parharpiniinae and Pontharpiniinae, dominant along temperate-tropical Indo-Pacific and antipodean shores, appear to be relict along northeastern Pacific shores. The Brolginae, common in protected coastal shallows of the northern and southern hemispheres, the Phoxocephalinae, world-wide mainly in deeper shelf waters, and the Harpiniinae, dominant on finer sediments and in deeper waters of the northern hemisphere, are well represented in the present study region. Within the present study region, the total number of species of these five subfamilies combined is slightly less than that of the single regional subfamily Metharpiniinae (Jarrett and Bousfield, 1994). The present species were also taken less abundantly at stations with sandy sedimentary bottoms. Such bias may reflect their overall preference for finer, softer sediments, at greater depths, habitats that were not extensively sampled in present surveys. Only a few species of these subfamilies, notably within the primitive sand-burrowing Pontharpiniinae, occur commonly intertidally.",
