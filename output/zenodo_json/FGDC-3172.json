    "description": "This report references age distribution data of invertebrate species (Protothaca staminea); oil contaminant data of algal communities, algal species (Fucus gardneri), invertebrate communities, and invertebrate species: Littorina scutulata, Littorina sitkana, Mytilus trossulus, Protothaca staminea, and Saxidomus giganteus, and sediment; and population abundance data of algal communities, algal species (Fucus gardneri), invertebrate communities, and invertebrate species: Littorina scutulata, Littorina sitkana, Mytilus trossulus, and Protothaca staminea from Prince William Sound, Alaska.\n\n  The aforementioned data are referenced in citation: Houghton, J. P., W. B. Driskell, D. C. Lees, and A. J. Mearns.  1991.  Impacts of the Exxon Valdez spill and subsequent cleanup on intertidal biota - 1 year later.  In Proceedings of the 1991 International Oil Spill Conference, 4-7 March 1991, San Diego, California, PP. 467-475.  AKPI Publication No. 4529, American Petroleum Institute, Washington, DC.\n\n  This literature was collected as part of a metadatabase that represents one or more nearshore resources (from physical attributes such as water and air, to birds and mammals).  Each entry is viewable in three formats, 1) a geospatial explicit format (ArcView 3.3) named GIS ArcView 3.3 Near GEM project, 2) a spreadsheet format (Excel 2002 and within ArcView) named GEM Nearshore Metadata Set, and 3) a ProCite database named GEM Nearshore Metadata References, which consists of references included in 1 and 2 above.  The ProCite database record number corresponds to the Excel Procite Number.  Reference Procite #476 for this literature's metadata.\n\n  The metadata are maintained in digital format (ArcView 3.3, Excel 2002, and Procite) and are available from the Alaska Science Center, USGS in Anchorage, Alaska.\n\n  For a detailed description of the three databases and the project, see \"Bodkin, J. L., and T. Dean.  2003.
