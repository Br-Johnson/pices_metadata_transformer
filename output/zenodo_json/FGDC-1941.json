    "description": "Analytical and idealized-numerical models were used to understand the physical processes that govern the seasonal variations and fate of the freshwater in the Alaska Coastal Current (ACC).  The ACC is forced by freshwater inflow and by mean easterly winds that cause downwelling over the shelf.  Two-dimensional modeling using a \"line-source\" buoyant inflow gives scales for the coastal current depth and width that depend upon the time, Coriolis frequency, the reduced gravity, and the freshwater inflow rate.  Addition of downwelling wind stress causes a steep coastal current front that intersects the bottom and is either convecting, stable and steady, or stable and oscillatory depending upon the bottom depth, the Ekman depth and the cross-shelf buoyancy gradient.\n\nThree-dimensional modeling of a half-line source initial develops two dimensionally but becomes three dimensional from a balances between coastal influx of buoyancy and its downstream transport.  This balance yields a coastal current scale depth that depends upon alongshelf distance, Coriolis frequency, the reduced gravity, and the freshwater inflow rate.  This limit is unchanged under downwelling wind stress and is reached in time scales of less than 1 month for the ACC.  The half-line source coastal current width develops in accord with the two-dimensional solution downstream of the origin of the half-line source.  Downwelling wind stress results in an approximate balance among the stress and along- and cross-shelf momentum advection so that the current width is a function of the Rossby radius of deformation, freshwater inflow rate, wind stress, Coriolis frequency, and ambient density.\n\nWaves and eddying motions eventually grow in the half-line source coastal current with wavelengths proportional to the coastal current width and with a downstream phase speed slower than the maximum current speed.  These features cause an offshore flux of buoyant water, a broader coastal current and accumulation of buoyancy on the shelf.  Increasing downwelling wind stress reduces the effects of the instabilities.  Although buoyancy accumulates on the shelf during most model runs, there is little accumulation under maximum downwelling wind stress.  This suggests that freshwater accumulates on the shelf from spring through fall, but is then transported downstream during winter.  \n\n[ Notes: This is the final report of this project which consisted of a student's PhD thesis ]",
