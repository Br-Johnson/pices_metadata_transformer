    "description": "TNFRI maintains a repeated observation line along 37°N, which extends from the coast of Japan to 164°E.  The line is observed once a year (May-June).  Data include Chl-a concentrations, sub-surface nutrients, phytoplankton species, primary production, micro-zooplankton abundance, zooplankton species, micronekton, etc.  \n\n[ Reference: PICES Scientific Report No. 18 2001, Proceedings of the PICES/CoML/IPRC Workshop on \"Impact of Climate Variability on Observation and Prediction of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes in the North Pacific\", http://www.pices.int/publications/scientific_reports/Report18/default.aspx. ]",
