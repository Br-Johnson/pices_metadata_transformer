    "description": "The objective of this study was to measure the effects of oil contamination on the Northern fur seal through studies on the thermal conductance of pelts, dive performance and alterations in the metabolic thermal conductance in pelts of fur-bearing marine mammals with that of nonfur-bearing species to determine whether surface fouling might be a major route of impact for all species.",
