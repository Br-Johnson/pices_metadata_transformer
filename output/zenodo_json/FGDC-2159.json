    "description": "This report references morphometrics, population abundance, and species composition data of fish species (Hexagrammos decagrammus); population abundance data of invertebrate communities; and population abundance, oil contaminant, and species composition data of various invertebrate species from Hartney Bay, Copper River Delta and Galena Bay, Gravina Point, Nelson Bay, Port Etches, Port Valdez, Port Wells, Sheep Bay, Simpson Bay, Unakwik Inlet, and Prince William Sound, Alaska.\n  Referenced invertebrate species include: Clinocardium ciliatum, Clinocardium nuttali, Dermasterias imbricata, Evasterias troschelii, Littorina scutulata, Littorina sitkana, Macoma balthica, Macoma nasuta, Macoma spp., Mya arenaria, Mytilus trossulus, Pisaster  ochraceus, Protothaca staminea, Pycnopodia helianthoides, Saxidomus giganteus, Siliqua patula, Spisula polynyma, Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis, and Telmessus cheiragonus.\n\n  The aforementioned data are referenced in citation: Feder, H. M. and A. J. Paul.  1978.  Biological cruises of the R/V Acorna in Prince William Sound, Alaska from 1970-1973.  Inst. Mar. Sci. Rept., R77-4 (Sea Grant Rept. 76-6), Univ. Alaska, Fairbanks. 76pp.\n\n  This literature was collected as part of a metadatabase that represents one or more nearshore resources (from physical attributes such as water and air, to birds and mammals).  Each entry is viewable in three formats, 1) a geospatial explicit format (ArcView 3.3) named GIS ArcView 3.3 Near GEM project, 2) a spreadsheet format (Excel 2002 and within ArcView) named GEM Nearshore Metadata Set, and 3) a ProCite database named GEM Nearshore Metadata References, which consists of references included in 1 and 2 above.  The ProCite database record number corresponds to the Excel Procite Number.  Reference Procite #332 for this literature's metadata.\n\n  The metadata are maintained in digital format (ArcView 3.3, Excel 2002, and Procite) and are available from the Alaska Science Center, USGS in Anchorage, Alaska.\n\n  For a detailed description of the three databases and the project, see \"Bodkin, J. L., and T. Dean.  2003.
