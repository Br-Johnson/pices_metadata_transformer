    "description": "Parameter\nGroundfish catch and effort data for  trawl, sablefish trap and longline gear types\n\nThe catch and effort data were obtained from daily logbooks filled out by fishers.  Information recorded and stored in the database include area and depth of capture, amount of effort expended, species caught and amounts. Includes trawl, sablefish trap and longline fisheries\n\nGeographic Area\nPacific coast of Canada\n\nPublication\nAnnual Reports, CDFO Technical Reports\n\nOther Comments\n\"Trawl catch and effort data is available from 1954-1995.  Information for trap is available from 1979-1995 and longline information is available from 1979-1985.  \nCollection of catch and effort data is continuing but data will be housed in a new \nrelational database that is in its final phases of development.\nThroughout the years the GFCATCH database has evolved and most changes have only been documented internally.  Please contact the custodian for more details on the database.\"\n\n[ A TCODE project ]",
