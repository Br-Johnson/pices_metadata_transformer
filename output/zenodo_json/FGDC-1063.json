    "description": "In response to the identification of areas of deficiency in tsunami research, a group of scientists and government representatives developed a coherent research plan\nto address these problems. The plan is designed to foster a course of action that will focus research on forecasting tsunami dangers and evaluating coastal hazards. A\nbrief review of the status of tsunami research is presented and needs for priority research are identified. The three highest need areas are 1) tsunami observational\nprogram, 2) modeling and design related to terminal effects, and 3) tsunamigenic earthquake identification. Two moderate need areas include the creation of a\ntsunami data set and the development of emergency preparedness programs.",
