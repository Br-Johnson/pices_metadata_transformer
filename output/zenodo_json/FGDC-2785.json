    "description": "The Alaskan Stream ceased to flow northward into the western Bering Sea, starting in summer 1990. This unexpected lack of inflow, caused by a southward shift in the path of the Alaskan Stream, persisted through at least fall 1991. If the anomalous flow continues, substantial changes in the physical environment will occur, possibly leading\nto impacts on the rich fisheries stocks in the region.",
