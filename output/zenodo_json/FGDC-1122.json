    "description": "Acoustic extensometer instruments capable of making precise daily measurements of horizontal distance were deployed across the north rift zone of Axial Volcano\nin June 1996 and were in place when a submarine eruption began on Axialﾒs south rift zone in January 1998. The instruments recorded a gradual 9-cm extension\nover a 405-m baseline leading up to the eruption, and then an abrupt, 4-cm contraction at the time of the eruption. An elastic point-source deformation model shows\nthat deflation of Axialﾒs summit can explain both the 4-cm distance decrease at the extensometer array and a 3.2-m subsidence measured by another instrument in\nthe caldera, if the pressure source is located at a depth of 3.8 km below the center of the caldera. The 9-cm distance increase may represent pre-eruption spreading\nacross the rift zone.",
