    "description": "Knowledge of the collection efficiency of sediment traps, particularly under conditions of varying current speed, is presently more a matter\nof hope than confidence. We report here on a field experiment designed to determine, for a particular trap geometry, the effect of current\nspeed and particle fall velocity on the collection efficiency of a moored trap relative to the presumably unbiased efficiency of an identical\ndrifting trap. The experiment was performed in a deep estuarine tidal passage where a smoothly varying unidirectional flow and a spatially\nhomogeneous particle population mimicked laboratory flume conditions. A multiple-sample sediment trap integrated to a current meter\npartitioned the mass flux collected by the moored trap into one of four chambers according to the following speed intervals: <12, 12≤30,\n30≤50, and 50 cm/s. The magnitude and particle characteristics of the flux collected at <12 cm/s were indistinguishable from those\nsimultaneously collected by drifting traps. At higher speeds, the relative efficiency of the moored trap ranged between 1% and 24% and\nthe mean size and density of the trapped particles increased. These results support predictions based on laboratory studies that collection\nefficiency decreases with an increase in the trap Reynolds number or a decrease in particle fall velocity. The study demonstrates that\nconsideration must be given to scaling both trap diameter and aspect ratio according to the expected flow conditions, and that knowledge\nof flow conditions at the trap mouth is necessary to properly interpret the flux data.",
