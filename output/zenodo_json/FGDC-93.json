    "description": "This report presents a series of computer-generated maps detailing the spatial and temporal distributions of 37 invertebrate species in the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort seas region. The maps illustrate the information content of the living marine resources\nComputer Mapping and Assessment System (Cmas) developed for the region, and serve as a reference for system users. Similar maps have been developed for fishes (21 species), marine birds (26 species), and marine mammals (14 species) as part of the\nSEA Division's atlas development process. A digital database and supporting software provide straightforward access to simple, yet informative analytical capabilities, such as developing composite distributions using a variety of weighting schemes for any\ncombination of species, species characteristics, life history stages, time periods, or spatial units. \n\nNOAAServer Codes: [OL 72 55 -130 -168] ; nodateline obtain",
