    "description": "The Coded-Wire Tag (CWT) is a small piece of magnetized stainless steel wire with a code etched on the surface. A standard-sized CWT is 1.1 mm long x 0.25 mm diameter and is generally used on juvenile salmon larger than 2 g in weight. For smaller salmon averaging as little as 0.2 g, tags half this length can be used (lower picture).  Since 1968, 82 Federal, State, Indian, and private agencies in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, California, and British Columbia have released over 600 million salmon with CWTs. Currently, over 45 million young salmon are marked with CWTs and released to migrate into the Pacific Ocean every year.  Information on the release, sample, and recovery of all CWT salmonids throughout the Pacific region is available in an on-line coastwide database, the",
