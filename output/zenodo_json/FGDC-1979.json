    "description": "This winter's El Ni￱o weather pattern has sent storm after storm into the U.S West Coast and brought heavy snows to New England states. The weather phenomenon also is influencing a warmer-than-normal winter as far north as Alaska. And as Doug Schneider reports in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio, the North Pacific's latest El Ni￱o may have important long-term impacts on Alaska's commercial fisheries.",

    "notes": "Purpose: Six months ago, when scientists first noticed ocean temperatures rising in the equatorial South Pacific Ocean, they predicted the United States would experience a mild El Ni￱o in the coming winter. As winter approached, the periodic phenomenon that alters weather patterns sent a string of storms surging into California, Oregon and Washingtonﾗstorms that have dumped heavy snows as far east as the New England states.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: None\n\nUse constraints: None\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
