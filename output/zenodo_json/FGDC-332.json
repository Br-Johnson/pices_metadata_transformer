    "description": "The analysis of weekly SST maps constructed at VNIRO on basis of satellite data for the 1995-1999 period was carried out.  As it is known, formation of ice interrupts the process of air-sea interaction delaying the extension of winter convection into deep water.  Ice cover acts as an isolator preventing the sea from cooling.  In this paper I consider duration and dates of beginning and ending of ice period of various  aquatories of the Okhotsk and Bering Seas during 1995-1999.  In the eastern Sea of Okhotsk the duration of ice margin staying south of 53 N was selected as a criterium of ice cover extension.",
