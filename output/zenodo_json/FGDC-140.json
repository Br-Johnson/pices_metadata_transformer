    "description": "Author and title of this book: U.S. Hydrographic Office, Deep Sea Soundings in the North Pacific\n               Ocean \n\n               Call number: C/na U58h-D 2927 \n\n               Number of books: 1 \n\n               This book is a part of the foreign meteorological data collection held by the NOAA Central Library in\n               Washington, DC. Information in this collection dates back to the 18th century for daily, monthly,\n               seasonal, and annual tabular summaries, and the 19th century for weather maps. These data are the\n               result of foreign exchange agreements, but the collection has not been updated since 1983. \n\n               In these summaries, definitions are: \n\n               1. Hourly/daily/monthly/seasonal/annual data -- values determined for each consecutive period, e.g.\n               monthly temperature data: Jan 1900, Feb 1900, etc. \n\n               2. Long-term data -- values determined over a period of years, e.g. long-term monthly temperature\n               data using Jan 1901, Jan 1902, etc. \n\n               This book contains tables and diagrams of daily fathoms and temperature of North Pacific Ocean from\n               1873 to 1874. \n\n               Tables include the following data: \n\n               - daily depth (soundings) of North Pacific Ocean (includes nature of bottom) - daily temperature at\n               various fathoms of North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea \n\n               Diagrams illustrate the following data: \n\n               - soundings and isothermal lines of North Pacific Ocean.",
