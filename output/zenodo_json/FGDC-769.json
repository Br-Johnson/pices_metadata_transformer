    "description": "Data Type: Vegetation/Land Cover/Soils;  This data set depicts a cross section of the Western Copper River Delta vegetation types, spanning from the mountains to the coast mapped on 1959-1986 aerial photography. A broad classification scheme used separates forest, scrub, herbaceous, and aquatic types. Polygons were digitized using Carto Instruments software and analyzed using ARC/INFO software. Generated acreage calculations of types over time are used to evaluate spatial juxtaposition of vegetation types.",
