    "description": "The combination of a broad continental shelf, extensive winter ice coverage and convergence of nutrient-rich currents systems position the Bering Sea as one of the most productive ecosystems in the world.  The Bering Sea is seasonal or year-round home to some of the largest marine mammal, bird, fish and invertebrate populations among the world's oceans and supports some of the world's largest commercial harvests of seafood, including groundfish, salmon and crab.",
