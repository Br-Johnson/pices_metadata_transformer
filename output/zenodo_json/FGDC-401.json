    "description": "The distribution and ecology of mesopelagic fauna are presented based on collections made by Russian, Japanese and US researchers in the western and eastern Bering Sea between 1979 and 1991.  The findings from these three independent data sets represent the most extensive description of mesopelagic fish and cephalopod distribution across the Bering Sea to date, and further demonstrate the importance of mesopelagic nekton in the ecology of the Bering Sea.",
