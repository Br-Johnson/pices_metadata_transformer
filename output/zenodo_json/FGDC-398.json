    "description": "This addresses the issues of modeling and marine ecosystems with a particular focus on the Bering Sea.  It is divided into three sections.  In the first, we attempt to lay a conceptual foundation for ways to think about ecosystems.  Next, we describe three kinds of models (trophic, process, and conceptual) and how they have been used to gain various levels of insight about the Bering Sea ecosystem.  Finally, we discuss the concept of ecosystem management as applied to the Bering Sea and how models of various kinds might help facilitate the process.",
