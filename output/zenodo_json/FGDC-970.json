    "description": "An advective model was used to simulate the drift of larval walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) over a 40-day period (late April\nthrough early June) near Shelikof Strait, Alaska. This model was used: (i) to assess how much of the observed change in larval positions\nduring that period can be explained by transport at fixed depth; (ii) to demonstrate that observed change can be related to mean\nlarge-scale meteorological forcing; and (iii) to investigate accumulation of larvae in specific areas near the coast. Based on availability of\nlarval and circulation data, three years were studied: 1988, 1989 and 1991. Velocity fields generated from a hydrodynamic model driven\nby winds and runoff were used to advect particles seeded in accordance with observed larval distributions in late April of each year. The\nmodelled larvae were tracked at 40 m depth, corresponding to the mean depth of sampled larvae and the depth of neutrally buoyant\ndrifters employed in field studies. Specific features observed in late May larval surveys were reproduced by the model, such as the\naccumulation of larvae in a shoal area downstream of the strait. Differences among the modelled years include extensive flushing of larvae\nto the south-west in 1988 and 1991, vs. limited flushing in 1989. These differences appear related to the mean large-scale atmospheric\npressure patterns for April-May of those years.",
