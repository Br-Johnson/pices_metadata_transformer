    "description": "On 7-10 April 1976, the submarine USS Gurnard participated in the Arctic Ice Dynamics Joint Experiment (AIDJEX) by traversing 777 nautical miles along 3 tracklines in the Beaufort Sea. The resulting data set of ice thickness data originated from upward-looking acoustical soundings (sonar). Data are ice profiles, including latitude/longitude, ping interval, surface beam diameter, number of data points and ice thickness.",
