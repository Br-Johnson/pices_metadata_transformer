    "description": "The National Fisheries Research and Development Institute (NFRDI) conducted an echo-integration midwater trawl survey of walleye Pollock in the Bering Sea including the Bogoslof Island area by the Korean R/V Pusan 851 during July 1994. Track lines and oceanographic survey stations are fixed and sampled every year for the years 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1999. Water temperature and salinity profile data were collected at 40 oceanographic research stations by a CTD system. At each CTD station chlorophyll and Zooplankton abundance  were measured. Zooplankton were sampled with a bongo net using a 333 micron mesh codend and sorted to genus. Biological samples of Pollock were taken as fish schools were encountered. Pollock data included length frequency data, sex ratio measurements, and otolith samples for age determination.",
