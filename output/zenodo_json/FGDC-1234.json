    "description": "Hull-mounted sonar systems, such as Sea Beam, are typically used for mapping the bathymetry of the deep-sea floor. The same digital information that is used for\nthe measurement of depth can be evaluated for the backscattering properties of the seafloor. The unique morphologies and petrologies of volcanic and hydrothermal\nterrains may produce identifiable backscatter signatures. The Alvin support vessel Atlantis II is equipped for digitally acquiring Sea Beam backscatter energy\ntraces, allowing sonar remote sensing and submersible exploration to be performed in tandem. An experiment funded by the National Undersea Research Program,\nat Axial Seamount, Juan de Fuca Ridge, has produced the most extensive data set to date from a known hydrothermal area, and these data are being calibrated\nusing the large groundtruth data base collected by NOAA's VENTS research program.",
