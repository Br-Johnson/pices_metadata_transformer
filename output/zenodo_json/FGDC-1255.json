    "description": "Since August 1991, the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has continuously monitored U.S. Navy hydrophone arrays in the North Pacific for seismic, volcanic, and marine mammal acoustic studies. Results to date have demonstrated that hydroacoustic monitoring lowers the detection threshold for submarine earthquakes versus the land seismic network, permitting the monitoring of volcanic activity on seafloor spreading centers and underwater seamounts. Marine mammal vocalizations are simultaneously monitored, leading to the discovery of\n\"acoustic stocks\" of blue whales in the Pacific and previously unknown migratory pathways. NOAA/PMEL has recently developed, deployed and maintained long-term autonomous hydrophone instruments in the equatorial Pacific, North Atlantic, and Gulf of Alaska.",
