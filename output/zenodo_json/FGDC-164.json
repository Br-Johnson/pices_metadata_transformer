    "description": "Approximately 1,600-line km of high-resolution seismic reflection\ndata are now available in the Navarin Basin, northern Bering Sea.\nThe data were collected in August 1982 from the U.S. Geological\nSurvey (USGS) Research Vessel S.P. LEE and deals with seafloor\nhazards pertinent to Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas lease\nsale activity.  Microfile copies of the seismic records are\navailable for purchase from the National Geophysical Data Center\n(NGDC).  The U.S. Geological Survey, Department of Interior has\nprovided these data to NGDC for public dissemination.",
