    "description": "We synthesize recent work conducted over this exceptionally broad (~500 km) shelf which generally has only slow mean flow (~2 cm/sec). Hydrographic structure is little influenced by this flow, but rather is formed primarily by boundary processes: tidal and wind stirring; buoyancy input from insulation, surface cooling, melting, freezing, and river runoff; and lateral exchange with the bordering oceanic water mass. Three distinct hydrographic domains can be defined using vertical structure to supplement temperature and salinity criteria. Inshore of the 50 m isobath, the coastal domain is vertically homogeneous and separated from the adjacent middle domain by a narrow (~10 km) front. Between the 50 m and 100 m isobaths, the middle domain tends toward a strongly stratified two-layered structure, and is separated from the adjacent outer domain by a weak front. Between the 100 m isobath and the shelf break (~170 m depth), the outer domain has surface and bottom mixed layers above and below a stratified interior. This interior has pronounced fine structure, as oceanic water intrudes shoreward from the weak haline front over the slope, and shelf water (middle domain) intrudes seaward across the 100 m isobath. These domains and their bordering fronts tend to persist through winter, although the absence of positive buoyancy often makes the middle shelf vertically homogeneous.",
