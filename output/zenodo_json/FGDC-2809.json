    "description": "Approximately 12,396 Pacific cod, Gadus macrocephalus, were tagged and released from fishery research vessels in the eastern Bering Sea and adjacent waters between 1982 and 1990. Recapture data from 373 tags recovered through the first quarter of 1992 revealed a strong seasonal component in fish movement between summer and winter areas. Prespawning fish were tagged throughout their summer distribution, primarily over the inner and middle shelf (<30-100 m depths), and recaptured on the outer shelf (> 100-200 m) and upper continental slope (>200 m) in subsequent quarters. Recoveries from the winter quarter (January-March) showed the most directed movement, when Pacific cod aggregated in major spawning areas between Unalaska and Unimak islands in the eastern Aleutian Islands, seaward of the Pribilof Islands along the shelf edge in the eastern Bering Sea, and near the Shumagin Islands in the western Gulf of Alaska. By early summer, a hypothesized postspawning dispersal was observed from these overwintering areas, when tagged Pacific cod moved from deep off-shelf waters to shallower depths on the eastern Bering Sea shelf. The importance of seasonal migration was examined statistically by contingency table analysis, which indicated that season of recovery affected area of recovery more than either the season or area of tagging. Seasonal movements were further quantified by modeling the population dynamics of tagged individuals, which allowed estimation of the seasonal distribution in the eastern Bering Sea population. These estimated seasonal distributions compare well with the seasonal distribution of catches from the commercial fisheries. This analysis of tag-recapture data suggests a single winter spawning population in the eastern Bering Sea, nearby waters of the Aleutian Islands, and western Gulf of Alaska waters between longitude 157 degree W and 170 degree W.",
