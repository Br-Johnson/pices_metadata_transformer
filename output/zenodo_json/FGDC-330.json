    "description": "Daily food ration was calculated at 3, 0-5, 1 % BW for the Korf-Karaginsky herring sized 25 - 35 cm in summer of 1998.  Euphausiids portion varied from 35, 6 to 100%.  Mature herring fed 2% (21, 5 x 10 to the third, tons) from total euphausiids biomass on feeding area.  Besides, euphausiids are consumed by herring juveniles, Pollock, salmon and other fishes.  Despite high euphausiids productivity, some tightness is imminent in correspondent links of shelf fish community trophic web.  Extension of feeding area is inherent for pelagic fishes during high abundance.  Whether herring will migrate in the offshore western Bering Sea for utilize its food resource or not?",
