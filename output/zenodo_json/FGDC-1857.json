    "description": "Satellite tracking of Steller sea lion movements via the Argos satellite telemetry system.  Instruments attached to sea lions by NMML researchers are equipped with a pressure sensor and a saltwater conductivity sensor to collect information on diving behavior and time spent on land and at sea. The saltwater conductivity sensor determines when sea lions are on land or when the instrument comes out of the water as the animal surfaces to breathe at sea. The sensor triggers the transmission of a message to NOAA polar orbiting environmental satellites carrying receivers for the Service Argos global data telemetry and geo-positioning system.  If a satellite is in view and receives the message or \"uplink\", the Argos system relays the messages to ground based receiving stations and the data are provided to NMML for analysis and interpretation. Data from active transmitters displayed on the map viewer are sent to NMML automatically every 24 hours, providing near real-time tracking information on sea lion movements.  \n\n[ Reference: PICES Scientific Report No. 18 2001, Proceedings of the PICES/CoML/IPRC Workshop on \"Impact of Climate Variability on Observation and Prediction of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes in the North Pacific\", http://www.pices.int/publications/scientific_reports/Report18/default.aspx. ]",
