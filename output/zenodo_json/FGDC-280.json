The water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen and meteorological factors were recorded as well as nutrients data in some years and months.\n\nGeographic Area\nwaters around Korea\n\nCustodian\nKorea Oceanographic Data Center\n\nBase Internet/URL -- ( http://www.nfrda.re.kr/kodc/data/data_e.html )  ( http://www.nfrda.re.kr/kodc/data/sodata/index.html)  \n[ A TCODE project ]",
