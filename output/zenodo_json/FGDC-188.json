    "description": "To investigate the composition and distribution of ichthyoplankton in the southeastern Bering Sea, ichthyoplankton was collected during 15 April through 20 April, 1994 at 51 stations.  Pelagic fish eggs occurred at 23 stations and the eggs of walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) occupied 94.9% of the total fish eggs.  Walleye Pollock larvae occupied 91.3% of the total fish larvae.  Pleuronectidae occupied 4.7% of the total. The distribution of pelagic eggs and fish larvae during spring in the southeastern  Bering Sea showed that the adjacent area of Unimak Pass in Aleutian Islands was important as a spawning ground of walleye pollock and the continental slope was important as a nursery ground of fish larvae including walleye Pollock.",
