    "notes": "Purpose: Many of the items confiscated each year by law enforcement officers with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service were brought into the U.S. by people who just didn't know that what they had was illegal. \n\nThings like sealskin slippers and gloves, walrus tusks, and whale teeth are popular souvenirs, says Chris Andrews, a wildlife inspection officer with the service. Most people readily show officers what they have, but he says a few try to slip their souvenirs past inspectors.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required.\n\nUse constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
