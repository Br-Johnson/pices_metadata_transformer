    "description": "Contains counts of Steller sea lion pups on rookeries in Alaska.  Counts are of live pups only, does not include pups dead at the time of count.  The counts were made between 1961 and 2002 and were obtained by a variety of methods:  beach counts, aerial photographs, and observation from overlooks, skiffs, and ships.  A \"beach count\" is made by walking through the rookery and counting all pups.  These generally are the most accurate counts.  Counting pups from a viewpoint overlooking the rookery provides good counts at some rookeries but undercounts if any portion of the rookery is obscured from view.  Medium-format (5-inch) vertical photographs provide good pup counts at some sites, particularly in Southeast Alaska and in the eastern and central Gulf of Alaska.  Counts made from skiffs or ships may be very accurate for small numbers of sea lions but they will be imprecise for large groups.  This database is updated and modified periodically.  Users should check for the date the database was last modified.
