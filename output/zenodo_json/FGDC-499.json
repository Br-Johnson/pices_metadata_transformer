    "description": "To date, most lower trophic level research on the eastern Bering Sea shelf has concentrated on the role of the spring diatom bloom as the main annual production event. Over the Middle Shelf Domain, primary and secondary productions occur\nthroughout the summer supported by regenerated nutrients. During this period, standing stock of chlorophyll is relatively low (0.5 - 2 µg/l). Periodic outbreaks of diatoms can occur in response to erosion of the pycnocline and injection of nitrate and silicate\ninto the surface waters. Between these outbreaks, nano- and microzooplankton (<200 µm) are hypothesized to dominate nutrient cycling. During these periods microzooplankton may also provide the intermediary link between small flagellated primary producers and food for juvenile fishes. Recent recurring \"blooms\"\nof the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi require us to achieve a better understanding of summertime nutrient recycling and trophic transfer so that we can predict the effect, if any, E. huxleyi will have on higher trophic levels. We plan to dissect the summer pelagic food web and nutrient cycle of the Middle Shelf Domain to determine the relative\ncontribution of microzooplankton to these processes. Specifically we will investigate nutrient cycling and trophic transfer during two distinct phytoplankton communities: small flagellates (coccolithophores or other species) and diatoms. Juvenile Pollock, a nodal species in the Bering Sea ecosystem, forage on particle-grazing mesozooplankton and variations in summer food supply may affect their ability to accumulate energy stores for the harsh Subarctic winters.\n\nThis project also includes;\n\nEvelyn Lessard \nUniversity of Washington \n\nJeffrey Napp \nAlaska Fisheries Science Center, NOAA \n7600 Sand Point Way NE\nSeattle, WA  98115\njeff.napp@noaa.gov\nAn NPMR project",
