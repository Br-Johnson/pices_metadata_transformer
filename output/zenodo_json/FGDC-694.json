    "description": "Data Type: Freshwater System;   This dataset combines DNR photo revised hydrography at 1:63,360 scale with ADF&G's known upper and lower extents of anadromous fish streams for the EVOS spill affected areas in PWS, CIR, and KAP geographic regions. The use of this data is to provide anadromous fish stream data as a resource for use in the oil spill damage identification, oil spill response, habitat restoration activities.",
