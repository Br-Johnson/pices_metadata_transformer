    "description": "Summer is, for many Alaskans, the busiest season. The nearly perpetual sunlight allows Alaskans to go fishing, hiking, boatingï¾—or even catch up on long-undone chores.  Still, summer never seems to last long enough. Marking summer's passage is one of Alaska's most ubiquitous flowers, the fireweed. This week on Arctic Science Journeys Radio, writer Andy Hall comments on the fireweed's role in setting the pace of the season.",

    "notes": "Purpose: Summer in Alaska is the time when the midnight sun convinces me I can spend an entirely unreasonable amount of time out of bed, usually outside. The season's approach brings feelings of excitement and wariness: excitement for the activities that come with the warm weather and wariness because I feel as if I'm steeling for an endurance test.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required.\n\nUse constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
