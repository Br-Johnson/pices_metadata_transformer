    "description": "Parameter\nprofiles of temperature, salinity, oxygen and nutrients\n\nMeasurement Details\n\"Physical oceanographic profiles\nOver one million profiles dating back before 1900\nUpdated weekly: 80,000 new profiles per year. \nGlobal coverage, but primarily in north western hemisphere \nXBT, BT, CTD, Bottle, Bathy/Tesac.  Inventory from XBT, BT, CTD and Bottle Archives for 1975 - 1979 (165K) \nInventory from XBT, BT, CTD and Bottle Archives for 1980 - 1984 (149K) \nInventory from XBT, BT, CTD and Bottle Archives for 1985 - 1989 (149K) \nInventory from XBT, BT, CTD and Bottle Archives for 1990 - 1995 (116K)\"\n\nglobal, but primary focus is North Atlantic, North Pacific and Arctic oceans\n\nIOSPBS Data Distribution\nMost high quality, high resolution data for coastal B.C. waters exist at IOS and MEDS.  Recent data may not be available from MEDS.  Data are stored on-line in the DATA_LIBRARY (DATA_LIB).  Search tools are available to select specific subsets of these data, matching user-specified search criteria.\n\nPSARC_Utility\n\"Probably of little direct use in stock assessment.  There are significant issues of data quality and distribution that make automated \"\"aggregation\"\" of the data tricky. Potentially, these data could be used to create water column climatologies (and anomalies) for user-specified areas/regions.\"\n\nImprovements\n\"Improved software tools for \"\"slicing, dicing\"\" and aggregation of these data would be useful.\"\n\nBase Internet/URL -- http://www.meds.dfo.ca\n\n[ A TCODE project ]",
