    "description": "Environmentalists and fishermen have argued for years over whether dragging nets along the sea floor causes long-term harm to the ocean. Scientists in Alaska, where more than half the nation's seafood is harvested, recently joined with fishermen in an experiment to see firsthand the impacts of trawling on the Bering Sea.
