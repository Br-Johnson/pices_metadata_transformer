    "description": "10-m six-hourly means of surface winds computed from the Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center (FNMOC )  (http://www.fnmoc.navy.mil) on a 360 by 181 global spherical grid (1 degree).\nThe variables are as follows: \n1.Zonal Component of surface wind \n2.Meridional Component of surface wind \n3.Surface Wind Vector and Magnitude\n4.Zonal Component of surface wind stress\n5.Meridional Component of surface wind stress\n6.Surface Wind Stress Vector and Curl\n\nMethod: Wind speed and stress are computed for each 6 hour field before averaging.\nNote: Vector winds and wind stress are plotted on top of scalar wind magnitude and wind stress curl, however data file downloads will only yield wind magnitude and wind stress curl. To obtain vector quantities of wind speed and stress, you must download the zonal and meridional components separately. \n\nDownload or plot the data from the PFEL Live Access Server (LAS) (http://www.pfeg.noaa.gov/products/las.html)\n\nFor more information on the models used to compute these data see: \nﾷRosmond, T.
