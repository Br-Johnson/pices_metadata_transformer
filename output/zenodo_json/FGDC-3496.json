    "description": "This report references oil contaminant data of fish species: Clupea pallasi and Hexagrammos decagrammus and invertebrate species: Mytilus trossulus, Protothaca staminea, and Saxidomus giganteus from Alaska Peninsula, Cook Inlet, Gulf of Alaska, Kodiak Island, and Prince William Sound, Alaska.  Referenced areas include: Akhiok, Chenega Bay, Chiniak, Chugach Bay, Ivanof Bay, Karluck, Kashivak Bay, Kasitsna Bay, Kodiak, Larsen Bay, Old Harbor, Ouzinkie, Perryville, Point Bede, Port Chatham, Port Dick, Port Graham, Port Lions, Sadie Cove, Tatitlek, Windy Bay, and Yakutat, Alaska.\n\n  The aforementioned data are referenced in citation: Varanasi, U. et. al. 1993a. Volume I: survey of Alaskan subsistence fish, marine mammal, and invertebrate samples collected 1989-91 for exposure to oil spilled from the Exxon Valdez. NOAA Technical Memorandum NMFS F/NWC-12, Seattle, Washington.\n\n  This literature was collected as part of a metadatabase that represents one or more nearshore resources (from physical attributes such as water and air, to birds and mammals).  Each entry is viewable in three formats, 1) a geospatial explicit format (ArcView 3.3) named GIS ArcView 3.3 Near GEM project, 2) a spreadsheet format (Excel 2002 and within ArcView) named GEM Nearshore Metadata Set, and 3) a ProCite database named GEM Nearshore Metadata References, which consists of references included in 1 and 2 above.  The ProCite database record number corresponds to the Excel Procite Number.  Reference Procite #1031 for this literature's metadata.\n\n  The metadata are maintained in digital format (ArcView 3.3, Excel 2002, and Procite) and are available from the Alaska Science Center, USGS in Anchorage, Alaska.\n\n  For a detailed description of the three databases and the project, see \"Bodkin, J. L., and T. Dean.  2003.
