    "description": "Approximately 3,013 km of 24-channel seismic-reflection profiles\nare now available for the Norton Sound area extending out to the\neastern Bering Sea.  The profiles were collected by the U.S.\nGeological Survey (USGS) Research Vessel S.P. LEE during the\nsummer of 1978 (USGS Open File Report 84-4).*  A sound source of\nfive airguns was used with a volume of 1,326 cu. in. of air\ncompressed to approximately 2,000 psi.  The recording system\nconsisted of a 24-group streamer, 2,400 m long and a GUS (Global\nUniversal Science) model 4200 recording instrument.  Shots were\nfired every 50 m with the group interval at 100 m.  A 2-msec\nsampling rate was used in the field.  The field data were later\ndesampled to 4 msec during the demultiplexing process.\nNavigational control for the survey was by a Marconi integrated\nsatellite-Doppler sonar navigation system.  The seismic\nreflection record lengths are 7 sec.  The data have been\nprocessed in a sequence of editing, demultiplexing, velocity\nanalysis, stacking, deconvolution-filtering, and displayed on an\nelectrostatic plotter.",
