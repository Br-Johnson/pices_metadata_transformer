    "description": "Sediment cores, water, zooplankton and Arctic cod were sampled from the major basins across the Arctic Ocean in 1992, 1993 and 1994 to determine the composition, quantity and distribution of persistent organic contaminants. As well as, to provide an oceanographic and geochemical perspective for interpretation of contaminant data and to model the rate of transfer of these compounds within the Arctic. Sediment cores were analyzed for metals, PAHs, Total Carbon, Total Nitrogen, Orgainic. Dirty snow and ice were analyzed for PAHs. Water column filtered particulate and XAD resin extract were analyed for PAHs. Zooplankton and Arctic cod were analyzed for Nitrogen, Lip, Carbon and Nitrogen Isotopes, Pesticides and PCBs.",
