    "description": "Ecosystem researches have been started in TINRO-Center early in 1980s.  Up to now composition and marine communities in the Far Eastern Russian economic zone have been determined, allowing to estimate a place and role in them of commercially valuable species and to assess a bioproductivity of Russian Pacific waters on the whole.",
