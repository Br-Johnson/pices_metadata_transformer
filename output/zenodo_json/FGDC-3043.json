    "description": "This report references chemical composition or content, morphometrics, population abundance, and production data of algal species (Zostera marina) from Red Head Lagoon, Safety Cove, Sawmill Bay, and Stockdale Harbor, Prince William Sound, Alaska.\n\nMcRoy, C. P.  1970.  Standing stocks and other features of eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) populations on the coast of Alaska.   J. Fish. Res. Bd. Can. 27: 1811-1821.\n\n  This literature was collected as part of a metadatabase that represents one or more nearshore resources (from physical attributes such as water and air, to birds and mammals).  Each entry is viewable in three formats, 1) a geospatial explicit format (ArcView 3.3) named GIS ArcView 3.3 Near GEM project, 2) a spreadsheet format (Excel 2002 and within ArcView) named GEM Nearshore Metadata Set, and 3) a ProCite database named GEM Nearshore Metadata References, which consists of references included in 1 and 2 above.  The ProCite database record number corresponds to the Excel Procite Number.  Reference Procite #641 for this literature's metadata.\n\n  The metadata are maintained in digital format (ArcView 3.3, Excel 2002, and Procite) and are available from the Alaska Science Center, USGS in Anchorage, Alaska.\n\n  For a detailed description of the three databases and the project, see \"Bodkin, J. L., and T. Dean.  2003.
