    "description": "Hydrothermal fluids collected from the ASHES vent field in 1986, 1987, and 1988 exhibit a very wide range of chemical composition over a small area ( 60 m in\ndiameter). Compositions range from a 300°C, gas-enriched (285 mmol/kg CO), low-chlorinity ( 33% of seawater) fluid to a 328°C, relatively gas-depleted (50\nmmol/kg CO), high-chlorinity ( 116% of seawater) fluid. The entire range of measured compositions at ASHES is best explained by a single hydrothermal fluid\nundergoing phase separation while rising through the ocean crust, followed by partial segregation of the vapor and brine phases. Other mechanisms proposed to\nproduce chlorinity variations in hydrothermal fluids (precipitation/dissolution of a chloride-bearing mineral or crustal hydration) cannot produce the covariation of\nchlorinity and gas content observed at ASHES. There is good agreement of the measured fluid compositions with compositions generated by a simple model of\nphase separation, in which gases are partitioned according to Henry's law and all salt remains in the liquid phase. Significant enrichments in silica, lithium and boron in\nthe low-chlorinity fluids over levels predicted by the model are attributed to fluid-rock interaction in the upflow zone. Depletions in iron and calcium suggest that\nthese elements have been removed by iron-sulfide and anhydrite precipitation at some time in the history of the low-chlorinity fluids. The distribution of low- and\nhigh-chlorinity venting is consistent with mechanisms of phase segregation based on differential buoyancy or relative permeability. The relatively shallow depth of the\nseafloor (1540 m) and the observed chemistry of ASHES fluids are consistent with phase separation in the sub-critical or near-critical region.",
