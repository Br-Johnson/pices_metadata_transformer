    "description": "Like tree rings, the growth increments in the axial rod of sea pens may reflect long time series of environmental influence. An axial rod is the simple, unbranched endoskeleton of sea pens, which are octocorals that occur in all oceans from shallow to abyssal depths. The formation of these increments, however, is not well described. Twelve rods were extracted from sea pen colonies collected in the Bering Sea. Colonies were selected by total length: 25-29 cm, 99-124 cm, and 153-167 cm. First, rod growth was hypothesized from rod morphology and internal microstructure. Rod shape did not change with overall size suggesting isometric growth. Examination of the internal microstructure, however, suggested that colonies burrow deeper into the sediment with age so that the first-formed part of the calcified rod is at or near the base. Recent accretions likely cover all but the basal end of the rod. Thus, simple transverse sections taken just above the base, to avoid rugose material, should reveal most of the colonyﾒs growth history. Second, the number of growth increments, each comprised of a translucent and opaque zone, was found to vary with rod length, position along the rod, and magnification. At 16x, these increments averaged 0.08 mm (ﾱ 0.005 SE). However, at 100x, it was evident that each ﾓincrementﾔ was actually comprised of finer, c. 0.03-mm wide, increments. Higher magnification did not reveal any further nesting. The maximum number of increments was 132. Finally, an attempt was made to determine the temporal periodicity of growth zone interpretations, the decay of 210Pb over the length of a colony was analyzed. Lead-210 activities in a series of cores extracted from locations along the axial rod ranged from 0.691 ﾱ 0.036 to 2.76 ﾱ 0.13 dpm/g. Because 210Pb activity did not follow a pattern of decay over the length of the colony, a growth rate and corresponding age could not be determined.  \n\n[ An NPMR project ]  [ Co-PIs: Gregor M.
