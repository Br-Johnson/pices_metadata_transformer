    "description": "During the summer of 1994 a satellite-tracked drifter transited from the southeastern Bering Sea slope through Bering Strait by a route westward along the slope and then northward through Anadyr Canyon and Strait. The trajectory emphasizes the importance of a western location of northward flow on the Bering Sea shelf. The transit time was 2 months from Cape Navarin to Bering Strait with northward drift velocities of 5-40 cm/s.",
