    "description": "Patterns in pelagic fish spatial distribution have been linked to environmental factors, especially depth and temperature (ocean fronts).  This paper explores the relationship between school size, depth, temperature and location data extracted from a summer 1991 Bering Sea scientific fisheries acoustic survey, using morphological and other image enhancement techniques.",
