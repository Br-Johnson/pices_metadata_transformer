    "description": "Four species of Protoleodora and three species of Pileolaria are found in the\n     seas bordering the CIS. A new species, Protoleodora gracilis, found from the\n     South Kuril Islands to Wrangel Island and the Chukchi Sea is described. It\n     differs from other representatives of the genus primarily in the presence of\n     spines on the distal part of the mature brood chamber and a \"crown\" of 20-30\n     thin petals along its perimeter. For the new species, as well as Protoleodora\n     uschakovi, P. asperata, P. coronata, Pileolaria militaris, P. berkeleyana, and\n     P. marginata synonymies, information about the ecology and distribution, and\n     taxonomic comments are presented.",
