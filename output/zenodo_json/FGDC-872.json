    "description": "Data Type: Birds;   A cooperative effort between Michael McAllister, Wildland Resource Enterprises, C.J. Ralph, US Forest Service Redwood Science Laboratory, Arcada, CA. and John Piatt, National Biological Service, Anchorage, Alaska. Transects were recorded from the bridge of a 58 foot Seine Vessel while traveling between and during salmon and herring fisheries: Alexander Archipelago, Prince William Sound, Kenai Peninsula, Alaska Peninsula, and Bristol Bay. The majority of transects are near shore regions of the Gulf of Alaska. Absolute counts, behavior, flyways, fishholding, fledged young, and molt data are recorded throughout surveys. Additional relative distribution records were recorded for all bird species and migratory counts. The most extensive records are from northern Southeast Alaska. Latitude and Longitudes were recorded on NOAA National Ocean Service Charts.",
