    "description": "The 14-km SST fields consists of a specific set of information pertaining to global latitude and longitude intersections. The 0.125-degree resolution file, or 14-km field file covers 8 regions: 1) 18N-31N, 80W-98W; 2) 39N-52N, 123W-136W; 3) 28N-41N, 114W-136W; 4) 30N-46N, 60W-82W; 5) 18N-32N, 70W-85W; 6) 50N-62N, 126W-160W; 7) 50-70N, 157W-180W; and 8) 20N-32N, 105W-136W. This covers the Gulf of Mexico, Northwest Pacific Coast, Southwest Pacific Coast, Northeast Atlantic, Southeast Atlantic of the U.S., as well as the Bering and Chukchi Seas.\n\nThe 14-km file is used by the OCNMAP subsystem for the dynamic gross cloud test. With a latitude/longitude from the image product file, the OCNMAP subsystem accesses the nearest grid point in the SST field file to retrieve the field temperature. If the latitude/longitude desired is not available in the SST field files, this test is skipped.",
