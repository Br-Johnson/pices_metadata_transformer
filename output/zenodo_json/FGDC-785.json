    "description": "Bathymetric contours were generated from soundings collected by National Ocean Service vessels from 1900 to 1971. The 1:250,000 maps are available for U.S. coastal waters. Bathymetric contours are in meters, with 10 meter intervals out to 200 m, supplemented by 2 m contours. Beyond 200 m, contours are at 50 m intervals to maximum depth. The GIS database derived from these maps includes the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort Seas in western and northern Alaska. Approximately 100 maps.",

The maps serve as a basic tool for performing scientific, engineering, marine geophysical, and marine environmental studies.
