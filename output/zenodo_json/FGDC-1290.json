    "description": "Delegates from more than 100 countries met in Shanghai, China, this week, and approved a United Nations report that for the first time places the blame for climate warming squarely on the burning of fossil fuels. As Doug Schneider reports in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio, scientists believe global warming will have a particularly profound effect on the Arctic.",

    "notes": "Purpose: The meeting was of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Delegates from 101 nations, including the United States, Japan, England, and Saudi Arabia, spent four days going over each line of the 1,000-page report. \n\nDr. Kevin Trenberth, head of climate analysis at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, was present when delegates voted unanimously to approve the report. He says the panel issued its strongest statement yet about the cause of climate warming.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required.\n\nUse constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
