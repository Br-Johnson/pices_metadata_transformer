    "description": "To illustrate temporal and spatial patterns of pollock spawning and egg distribution in the southeast Bering Sea, ichthyoplankton survey data collected in the 1977 spawning season were analyzed.  A high concentration of pollock eggs was found near the boundary between the outer shelf and the middle shelf in April and the peak spawning data was 26 April with one standard deviation of 8 days.  The mean egg density ranged from 42.0 ~ 47.5 eggs/m(2) in April, but it decreased rapidly to 5.4 eggs/m(2) in mid May.  The total number of Pollock eggs spawned in the study area during 1977 spawning season was estimated to be 8.1 X 10 (12) based on ichthyoplankton surveys and 3.3 X 10 (13) eggs from reproductive parameters of the adult population in the east Bering sea.",
