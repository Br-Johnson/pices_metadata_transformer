    "description": "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Ocean Environment Research Division established a geographic information system (GIS) for integrating\nmultidisciplinary oceanographic data collected throughout the eastern North Pacific Ocean. Data collected by remote-sensing techniques include satellite imagery of\nsea surface temperature, seafloor bathymetry derived from multibeam sonar systems, and environmental acoustic signals from bottom-mounted and portable\nhydrophone arrays. Acoustic monitoring is directed at the detection and location of water-borne signals of seafloor earthquakes (T-waves) and whales. Field\nobservations include seafloor geologic mapping and whale sightings. Seafloor mapping information is gathered using submersibles, towed-camera systems, and other\ntowed water-sampling devices. A GIS allows the integration and analysis of these diverse and various spatial data and formats within a single computer architecture\naccessible through an easy-to-use graphical user interface. The GIS system described here has combined earthquake-source parameter information with acoustic\nlocations and seafloor bathymetric data to provide new tectonic models of NE Pacific oceanic plate boundaries. Similarly, whale locations are mapped and\ncompared to oceanographic features such as bathymetry and sea surface temperatures using GIS.",
