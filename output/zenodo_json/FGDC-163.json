    "description": "The National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) and the World Data\nCenter A for Glaciology**** jointly announce the availability of\ndata from two ice-gouge studies in the Beaufort Sea, Alaska.  The\nstudies were conducted by scientists with the U.S. Geological\nSurvey (USGS) and contain data, interpreted from side-scan sonar,\non the size, density, location, seawater depth, orientation of\ndominant and subordinate gouges, number, depth, frequency, width,\nand other relevant data for ice gouges in the Beaufort Sea.  The\nlarge size of the data set has required computer-assisted methods\nfor the analysis and correlation of the ice-gouge\ncharacteristics.  The data are available as two tape files.  File\n1 contains 2,071 records of data for the Beaufort Sea shelf west\nof the Canning River (USGS Open File Report 81-950).**  File 2\ncontains 372 records of data for the Beaufort Sea shelf east of\nthe Canning River (USGS Open File Report 82-974).",
