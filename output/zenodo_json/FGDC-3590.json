    "description": "Acoustic Data Library (ADL) for the broadband split-beam fish tracker.  Acoustic data has been collected from over 15 locations worldwide. With over 100 weeks of trials in oceans, lakes, rivers, and pools SciFish 2000 has successfully collected data for over 20 different species including Pacific herring, Lake sturgeon, paddlefish, Chinook and Sockeye salmon, Alaskan walleye pollock, jellyfish, krill, Pacific halibut, alewife, smelt, Pacific Cod, and Pacific Ocean Perch. The ADL consists of documentation, data and databases that serves as a repository for broadband acoustic data, its associated parameters, and collection conditions.",
