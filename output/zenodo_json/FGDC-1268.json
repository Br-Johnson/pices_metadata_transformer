    "description": "Scientists recently set out to see just how much mercury several species of Alaska fish, including salmon and pike, had in their livers and flesh. While salmon were given a clean bill of health, researchers say high levels of mercury found in a few pike underscores the need for a more comprehensive study. Doug Schneider has more in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio.",

    "notes": "Purpose: The mercury was found in the livers and muscle of 21 pike taken from tributaries of the lower Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers in western Alaska. Sathy Naidu is a marine scientist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and leader of the study. He says some of the pike tested had levels of mercury higher than what the U.S. Food and Drug\n Administration considers safe for human consumption.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required.\n\nUse constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
