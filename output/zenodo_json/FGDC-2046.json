    "description": "This report references oil contaminant data of algal species (Laminaria groenlandica), invertebrate species (Macoma balthica) and (Mytilus trossulus), and scoters (Melanitta spp.) from Cook Inlet, Alaska.\n\n  The aforementioned data are referenced in citation: Becker, P.R. 1979.  A synthesis of environmental information concerning potential OCS oil and gas development in Lower Cook Inlet. Science Applications Inc. Environmental assessment of the Alaskan continental shelf: Lower Cook Inlet interim synthesis report.  p. 201-220.\n\n  This literature was collected as part of a metadatabase that represents one or more nearshore resources (from physical attributes such as water and air, to birds and mammals).  Each entry is viewable in three formats, 1) a geospatial explicit format (ArcView 3.3) named GIS ArcView 3.3 Near GEM project, 2) a spreadsheet format (Excel 2002 and within ArcView) named GEM Nearshore Metadata Set, and 3) a ProCite database named GEM Nearshore Metadata References, which consists of references included in 1 and 2 above.  The ProCite database record number corresponds to the Excel Procite Number.  Reference Procite #115 for this literature's metadata.\n\n  The metadata are maintained in digital format (ArcView 3.3, Excel 2002, and Procite) and are available from the Alaska Science Center, USGS in Anchorage, Alaska.\n\n  For a detailed description of the three databases and the project, see \"Bodkin, J. L., and T. Dean.  2003.
