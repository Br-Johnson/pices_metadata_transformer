    "description": "Each summer, the frigid Bering Sea and Arctic Ocean off Alaska plays host to thousands of hungry gray whales. The whales come from the warmer waters of Southern California and Mexico to feed on the seafloor's rich abundance of tiny crustaceans. But over the last few years, hundreds of emaciated gray whales have washed up along the U.S. and Canadian west coast. Scientists think the whales might not be getting enough to eat, so this week a team of University of Alaska Fairbanks researchers are in the northern Bering Sea, following a hunch that these once-rich waters may not be so rich anymore. Doug Schneider has more in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio",

    "notes": "Purpose: Twenty years ago, when marine scientist Ray Highsmith last came to the northern Bering Sea,to the waters that separate Alaska and Russia, the ocean bottom was quite literally blanketed by colonies of tiny crustaceans called Ampelisca macrocephala. And feeding on these minute creatures were thousands of gray whales, some weighing more than 40 tons.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: None\n\nUse constraints: None\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
