    "description": "The data consist of continuous counts of  marine birds within a bounded transect.  Information on  species, number and behavior is entered for every observation in a hierarchical database. The data sets were concentrated in grids centered on the 50 m depth contour over the inner shelf of the southeastern Bering Sea and in the vicinity of the Pribilof Islands. The size of the data set is indicated by km  surveyed: Spring 1997-3992 km; Fall 1997-865 km; Spring 1998 - 3,786 km; Fall 1998- 1,065 km; Spring 1999- 3,940 km; and Summer/Fall 1999- 4,220 km.",

    "notes": "Purpose: The purpose of the research was to related the distribution and abundance of foraging shearwaters to physical and biological processes at the inner or structural front on the inner shelf of the southeastern Bering Sea. Additional data sets on food habits, body condition and fatty acid composition will be or are available to complement the survey data.  There are also data on physical processes and hydrographic structure  (Stabeno), nutrients (Whitledge), Zooplankton (Coyle), and primary productivity (Zeeman) that relate to this study.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: For collaborative use.\n\nUse constraints: For collaborative use.\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
