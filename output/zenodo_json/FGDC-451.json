    "description": "Meteorological observations: Every three-hour interval, covering the whole course.  Data are not presented here in order to save the printing cost, they will gladly supply by direct communication upon request. -  Hydrographic observations: at 52 stations throughout three cruises, 10-(1), 10-(2), 10-(3), covering depths from the surface down to 1000 meters. -  Analysis of water samples: Chrorinity was estimated by titration method after from the cruise.  -  Plankton sampling:  Vertical hauls with a fine mesh net, 30 cm x 150 cm, XX 13 from approximately 100 meter depth, once at each hydrographic station.  From approximately  150 meter depth, once at each hydrographic station.   \nHorizontal tows with a larva net, 130 cm X 450 cm stramin, through the surface layer for ten minutes at low speed at hydrographic stations and other stations:   -   Fish Larva sampling: From the mixed plankton samples collected with a 130 cm larva net.  -  Salmon grill-net set: Twenty-four operations were carried out throughout three cruises at different stations.  Specimens were used to the measurement of biological characters, observations on maturity, sampling of scales for later examination.",
