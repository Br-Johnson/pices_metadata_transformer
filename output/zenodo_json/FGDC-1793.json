    "description": "Scientists from Humboldt State University (Arcata, CA) conduct cruises off Eureka CA (40°50'N) during spring and early summer, as part of a program which trains undergraduates in oceanographic techniques.  Cruises are carried out approximately monthly, weather permitting.  Several stations over the continental shelf are sampled (out to a distance of 25 miles from shore).  At each station standard measurements are taken including CTD profiles, Secchi depths, and chlorophyll.  Zooplankton is sampled with a 60 cm bongo net fitted with 333 µm mesh nets.   \n\n[ Reference: PICES Scientific Report No. 18 2001, Proceedings of the PICES/CoML/IPRC Workshop on \"Impact of Climate Variability on Observation and Prediction of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes in the North Pacific\", http://www.pices.int/publications/scientific_reports/Report18/default.aspx. ]",
