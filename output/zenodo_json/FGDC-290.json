    "description": "CTD (conductivity/temperature/depth) casts were taken during sixteen occupations of a standard section across the southeastern Bering Sea shelf during 1995 - 1999. Vertical sections of temperature and salinity, plus computed geopotential anomaly values from ~ 31.3 to 33.1.  Nontidal flow was organized but was generally <5 cm s-1.  Six sections were obtained during 1997, a year with considerable sea ice.  The melting sea ice produced low salinity (<31.4) that altered geopotential gradients inshore and reversed the typical southeastward geostrophic flow.  Thus these waters are subject to large seasonal changes and occasional marked interannual ones.",
