    "description": "500 - hPa field and H500 geopotential anomalies structural peculiarities are analyzed in January 1950 - 1998 over the northwestern part of the Pacific (NWP).   \n\n500-hPa fields of 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s are determined.  The main differences of 500-hPa filed are in the position of Okhotsk low (area of low barometric pressure) and ridge of the Pacific high (area of high barometric pressure) these years.",
