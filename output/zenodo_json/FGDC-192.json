    "description": "Pollock is one of major fishery product providing Korean for protein food.  Moratorium is in force recently in high seas of North Pacific Ocean.  Trawl with the agreement among the fishing states and coastal states.  Korean Pollock industry has big difficulties in optimal business operation and efficient market for resource distribution.  Therefore the purpose of the paper is to analysis the management of North Pacific Pollock and its impact on Korean Pollock industry as well as its supply and demand structure in Korea.  The paper introduces the current status of domestic deep sea pollock industry and the fishery management of the United States. The prospect on the demand and supply of Pollock product shows were are ins short of Pollock about 60% of total domain in domestic market by the year 2001.  The conclusion suggests continuous expansion of foreign fishing ground and enforcement of fishery cooperation with coastal states as well as active participation in relating international bodies.",
