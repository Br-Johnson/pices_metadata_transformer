    "description": "The right whale is the most endangered of all the large whales. The population in the North Pacific is thought to number only a few hundred individuals and recent sightings in the eastern Bering Sea are the only encouraging sign for this species. We will study these individuals to identify (1) their summer and fall foraging range, (2) their presumed late fall migration route, and (3) their winter habitat. Previous research by our team has\nidentified North Atlantic right whales, Pacific blue whales, and Pacific humpbacks using oceanographic structures such as upwellings, eddies, and boundary regions as feeding areas. Our hypothesis is that similar areas may also be used by right whales of the North Pacific/Bering Sea.  We propose to tag and track right whales in the Bering Sea\nduring the next two years using satellite-monitored radio tags to identify these areas. We will correlate whale movements with bottom topography, television infrared observation satellite (TIROS)-N infrared images that provide sea surface temperature data (AVHRR) and productivity indices (SeaWiFS). MOCNESS samples will also enable us to identify prey species and to better describe the feeding habitats of right whales. Biopsy samples will be taken at the time of tagging to determine sex, examine genetic relationships, and test for contaminant levels.  The Central Scientific Issues of the North Pacific Marine\nResearch program suggest that we can learn more about the recent change in biological productivity in the Bering Sea ecosystem from right whales. We feel our research will provide substantial information regarding the seasonal movements of this\nlittle-known whale, which may help in better understanding species interactions within the Bering Sea ecosystem. Lipid content and contaminant testing of the biopsy samples will address body condition and risk from pollutants.\n\nAn NPMR project",
