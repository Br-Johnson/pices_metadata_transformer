    "description": "This database contains information gathered from complete medical necrospy of nearly 4,000 Pacific herring sampled from Prince William Sound (1994-2002) and Sitka Sound (1995-1997), Alaska. Data include age, weight, standard length; date, time, and location of capture; hold time before necropsy; gross and microscopic lesions (scored as none, mild, moderate, or severe); plasma chemistry analysis, white blood cell differential counts, and results from virus isolation of individual fish. Organs examined for microscopic lesions (histopathology) include liver, kidney, spleen, heart, gill, brain,\nstomach, intestine, pancreas, skeletal muscle, skin, and gonad.",
