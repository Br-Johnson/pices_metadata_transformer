    "description": "This file is a reservoir for AVHRR and HIRS/2 target data collocated with SST observation and buoy observation data. The target and SST observation data for selected geographic locations are written from a temporary file by an operational copy program once a day. The temporary file is created by the SST reduction program (MUT) on an orbit by orbit basis. Once a day, coincident buoy data is added to the appropriate target records in the Target Matchup Data Base (TMDB) by a merge program. A tape archive of the data base is made periodically by copying the disk to tape.\n\nThe file is a circular file of logical records, each 3150 bytes long, arranged in physical records of 3150 bytes. The first record is a header record containing a data record pointer and the starting and ending times of each directory record. The next 28 records are reserved as directory records. Directory records contain such information as the data record numbers, latitude and longitude, and times for groups of 150 data records. Each succeeding 3150 byte logical record is a data record which is the length of one colocated AVHRR and HIRS/2 target data matched with coincident buoy data and satellite SST observations. Note, the header and data records for the TARGET MATCHUP INITIAL STORAGE FILE (TMISF) have the same length and format as that of the TMDB. The file is large enough to hold 4200 observations.\n\nObservations are added to the file by checking the header to determine the next available record number. When the file becomes full, it is recycled beginning with the first data record (record #30) for observation storage. The appropriate directory record is then updated.\n\n\n  The Office of Satellite Data Processing and Distribution (OSDPC) keeps this data for a month, then sends it to the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) for archiving.
