    "description": "Data Type: Exxon Valdez Oil Spill;  The Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) data layer is essentially a classification of coastal geomorphology to allow assessment of the shoreline sensitivity to and capacity to cleanse itself of oil. The U.S. Minerals Management Service (MMS) and NOAA developed the ESI database prior to the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. Pacific GIS obtained the ESI data from the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill database. The environmental sensitivity of a particular beach segment is determined by the physical make-up of the shoreline, its biological sensitivity and the intensity of environmental processes within the local area. This data layer covers the Exxon Valdez oil spill region which includes Prince William Sound and areas to the west. Related information on actual oiling can be found in the documentation for oil_f89,",
