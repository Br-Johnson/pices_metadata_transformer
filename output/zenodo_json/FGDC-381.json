    "description": "It reviews and presents new data on the physical oceanography of the Bering Sea. It focuses on the basin, since a thorough review of the shelves has recently been completed (Schumacher and Stabeno 1998).  Further, since this volume contains an extensive review of the water property characteristics (Luchin et al., chapter 3, this volume), the primary goal is to review and update circulation over the basin.  We begin with the known and estimated transports through each of the passes of the Aleutian Islands, followed by a discussion of the surface and deep currents of the Bering Sea basin and the flow on the Bering Sea shelves.",
