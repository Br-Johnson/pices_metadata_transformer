    "description": "One-dimensional CTD data from the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea.  Collected data include temperature, salinity, attenuation, sigma-t, depth, potential temperature, sigma-theta, dynamic meters, and backscatter intensity.  There are 14600 files available for plotting and download.  Depth ranges from -2 to 4448 meters deep.  On-line access to the data and sectional cross plots is available.  Access to download data from individual casts in either ASCII or netCDF format is included.  A variety of plots of properties versus depth and property versus property plots can be generated on the fly and displayed to your screen.  On-line access to the data are accessible via a number of data selection utilities.  These utilities allow you to search the database and extract datasets meeting criteria such as geographic location, date and time, season of the year, and various other criteria.  Data were collected by the",
