    "description": "The Pacific Ocean is ringed around much of its margins by deep trenches.  Today long-term deep currents measurements over trenches at the western northern edges of the Pacific Ocean Central basin are available through Internet.  Observations of water properties and deep currents over several trenches in the Subarctic North Pacific give consistent evidence for recent ventilation of water below the trenches sills and cyclonic sign of circulation over the trenches.  The analysis of hydrographic data shows that the trenches are well ventilated by dense bottom water.   Within the trenches this bottom water  generally spreads away from its source and a cyclonic sign of circulation is also suggested over the trenches.  The mathematical model of Raleigh convection on the rotating earth in deep-water ocean depression is generalized for the case including the meridional temperature gradient.  The stability of a study-state thermal shear flow, caused by this gradient, has been studied with respect to the three-dimensional disturbances.  Critical parameters determining the convection are calculated for the Kuril Kamchatka and Japan trenches.  The velocity components of tidal flow have been calculated using the hypothesis of Prandtl way for bottom layer of trenches.",
