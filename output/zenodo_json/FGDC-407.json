    "description": "Marine bird populations in the Bering Sea have been monitored at selected colonies since the mid-1970's.  At the Pribilof Islands, declines of black-legged (Rissa tridactyla) and red-legged (R.brevirostris) kittiwake populations occurred between the mid-1970's and the mid-1980's.  Thick-billed murre (Uria lomvia) populations also declined at the Pribilof Islands during this period, as did common murres (U. aalge) at Bluff in Norton Sound.",
