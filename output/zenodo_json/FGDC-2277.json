    "description": "Phase One of a University of East Anglia Climatic Research Unit study of \"The Potential for Arctic Sea-Ice Prediction on Climatic Time Scales\" has produced a digital circumpolar ice limit for the years 1901 -1956. Data source is the ice charts produced by the Danish Meteorological Institute from ship, shore, and aerial observations. Data are displayed in a standard one-degree grid. Data reliability assessment was planned as phase two, but this phase has never been funded.",
