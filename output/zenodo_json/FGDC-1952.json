    "description": "During three days last month, scientists asked Alaskans and visitors to the state's coast to be on the lookout for killer whales. Scientists are trying to learn more about these highly successful predators and what role they may be playing in keeping Steller sea lion numbers low in parts of the state. Doug Schneider has more in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio.",

    "notes": "Purpose: When Kerry Irish decided to count Alaska's killer whales, she quickly realized that she couldn't possibly be everywhere along the state's 35,000 miles of coast at the same time. The next thing she realized was that other people are just as fascinated about these black-and-white whales as she is. It's a fascination she's trying to tap into.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: None\n\nUse constraints: None\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
