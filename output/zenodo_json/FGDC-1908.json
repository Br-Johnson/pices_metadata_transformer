    "description": "Bathymetric contours were generated from soundings collected during surveys and cruises by the Hydrographic Office, National Ocean Survey, and Coast and Geodetic Survey. The region covered by the map is the Bering Sea Shelf from Bristol Bay, Alaska to the Gulf of Anadyr, Russia. Bathymetry is in meters at 10 m intervals, with 5 m supplemental contours. The digitized portion includes the Anadyr Gulf and Bering Strait in Russian waters (west of the Exclusive Economic Zone), to supplement digitized National Ocean Service maps of US waters (Coastal Shelf Bathymetry of the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort Seas).",
