    "description": "The western stock of Steller sea lions has decreased by an estimated 81% over the past 30 years and is now listed as \"endangered\" under the Endangered Species Act. Evidence suggests links between low juvenile survival and nutrient limitations (i.e. diets of low quantity, quality, and diversity). Diets of Steller sea lions are diverse and include species of primary and secondary importance to commercial fisheries in Alaska. Thus\nfishing activity in haulout areas is assumed to negatively effect the ability of Steller sea lions to secure food. Based primarily upon assumptions about Steller sea lion foraging behavior and prey/habitat use, the National Marine Fisheries Service recently implemented legislation that disallows trawl fishing in 10 nmi radii around Steller sea lion haulouts. We hypothesize that the relative composition and abundance of prey species in the diet of Steller sea lions is directly related to availability of prey around critical haulouts in the Kodiak area. The location of Kodiak Island is central to the decline in the number of Steller sea lions and the local fishing industry is greatly impacted by the newly imposed no-trawl \"buffer zones\" around Steller sea lion haulouts.  Our project involves determining seasonal Steller sea lion abundance, distribution (through monthly aerial surveys), and diet (through quarterly scat collection) in the Kodiak Island region. Simultaneously, we will determine temporal (seasonal and annual) and spatial (10 and 20 nmi) composition, abundance and distribution of prey around five critical haulouts on the eastern side of Kodiak Island. We will compare the use of prey by Steller sea lions to seasonal and annual availability of prey both inside and outside of the buffer zones. These data ultimately will be of practical importance to fisheries managers and will provide basic knowledge of predator/prey dynamics in the Kodiak Island region.\nThis project also includes;  Brenda Norcross, bnorcross@ims.uaf.edu; Sue Hills, shills@ims.uaf.edu;  Loren Buck, cbuck@uaf.edu, Robert Foy, foy@ims.uaf.edu\n\nAn NPMR project",
