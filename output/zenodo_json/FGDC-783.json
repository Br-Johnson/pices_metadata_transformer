    "description": "Data Type: Vegetation/Land Cover/Soils;  Pacific GIS used several different full resolution vegetation datasets organized by 1:250,000 scale USGS quadrangles to cover the Prince William Sound - Copper River ecosystem. Pacific GIS based this merged layer on the Chugach NF Timber Type data but augmented it with information from the Interim Land Cover layer in areas where there are holes in the Timber Type layer. Please refer to the documentation for veg_tt and veg_ifc for a complete discussion of datasets used to create this hybrid data layer.",
