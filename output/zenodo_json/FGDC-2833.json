    "description": "Topographic planetary waves associated with the downstream leg of the Bering Slope Current are observed in measurements of sea surface height anomalies acquired by the Geosat altimeter during 1987 and 1988. The waves are most prominent from May to August 1987, during which time the estimated wave period and wavelength are about 72 days and 103 km, respectively. The direction of propagation is roughly north-northeast.",
