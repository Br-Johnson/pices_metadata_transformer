    "description": "The island of St. Vincent and the other Windward Islands in the\n     southeastern Caribbean were chosen as a field site for the study of weak\n     mountain wakes. By the authorsﾒ definition, a ﾓweak wakeﾔ forms when the\n     potential vorticity generated by a mountain is not strong enough to advect\n     itself into eddies; rather, it is simply advocated downstream by the ambient\n     flow. GOES-8 and Landsat sunlit images unambiguously revealed that the\n     mountainous Windward Islands have remarkably long straight wakes. The\n     length of St. Vincentﾒs wake exceeds 300 km although its width is only 20\n     km. Near the islands, the wake structures reflect the details of the island\n     topography. These wakes do not exhibit any obvious diurnal effect.\n\n       Boat surveys in the lee of St. Vincent confirmed the existence of features\n     seen in the images: the sharp wake boundary, the small valley-induced jet\n     embedded in the near wake, and the absence of any reverse flow. Aircraft\n     surveys gave evidence of descent over the island and showed that the wake\n     air is relatively warm and dry. The length of the wake (L) agrees with the\n     formula L = H/2CD (where H is the wake depth and CD is the surface drag\n     coefficient), implying that the reacceleration of the wake air is caused by the\n     ambient streamwise pressure gradient rather than by lateral entrainment of\n     momentum or geostrophic adjustment.\n\n       Two numerical models were used to simulate St. Vincentﾒs wake, a\n     single-layer hydrostatic model and a 3D nonhydrostatic model. Both models\n     indicated that air descent, acceleration, wave breaking, and weak potential\n     vorticity generation occur over the island, causing a long straight wake.",
