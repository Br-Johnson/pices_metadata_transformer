    "description": "In 2002, the twenty-fourth annual longline survey of the upper continental slope of the Gulf of Alaska and eastern Aleutian Islands was conducted.  One hundred forty-eight longline hauls (sets) were completed between 4 June 2002 and 3 September 2002.  Sixteen km of groundline were set each day, containing 7,200 hooks baited with squid.  When weather permitted a short experimental gillnet was fished during darkness at each station to assess the abundance of 0-age sablefish in near surface waters.",
