Selected data can be viewed as user-customizable, on-the-fly plots, listed, or downloaded.  Includes NOAA PMEL Pacific Ocean data observations from the tropics to the Arctic, and global data from the NODC World Ocean Database, served through the EPIC Web Browser and through OPeNDAP.",

Web access is available at http://www.epic.noaa.gov/epic/ewb/.  Most recently, OPeNDAP (formerly called DODS) access is available for OPeNDAP in-situ data clients at http://www.epic.noaa.gov:10100/dods.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: Continually\n\nAccess constraints: None\n\nUse constraints: None\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
