    "description": "A correct prediction of tidal currents and sea is highly important for the northeastern shelf of Sakhalin Island because of development of the oil and natural gas industries in this area.  The main problem of the tidal regime is determination of tidal harmonic constants (amplitudes and phases) from the available sea level and current observational series.",
