    "description": "PFEL specializes in analyzing the effects of environmental variability on fisheries. Due to its cooperation with the Navyﾒs Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center (FNMOC) (http://www.fnmoc.navy.mil/) and other data centers, PFEL has a wide variety of oceanographic and atmospheric datasets that are relevant to many areas of fisheries science, marine resource management, and climate change in the ocean. PFEL makes datasets available by converting them to common formats and making them readily available over the Internet. Also, PFEL has implemented a Live Access Server (LAS) (http://las.pfeg.noaa.gov/las/main.pl) which allows users to visualize, subset, and extract PFELﾒs data products over the Internet.\n\n[ Reference: PICES Scientific Report No. 18 2001, Proceedings of the PICES/CoML/IPRC Workshop on \"Impact of Climate Variability on Observation and Prediction of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes in the North Pacific\", http://www.pices.int/publications/scientific_reports/Report18/default.aspx. ]",
