    "description": "This thesis references diet and population abundance data of sea otters (Enhydra lutris) and diet data of invertebrate species: Clinocardium nuttali, Evasterias troschelii, Macoma incongrua, Mya truncata, Mytilus trossulus, Protothaca staminea, Saxidomus giganteus, Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis, and Telmessus cheiragonus from Ookhilk Lagoon and Port Chalmers, Prince William Sound, Alaska.\n\n  The aforementioned data are referenced in citation: Calkins, D. 1972. Some aspects of the behavior and ecology of the sea otter, Enhydra lutris, in Montague Strait, Prince William Sound, Alaska. University of Alaska. M.S. Thesis. 55 pp.\n\n  This literature was collected as part of a metadatabase that represents one or more nearshore resources (from physical attributes such as water and air, to birds and mammals).  Each entry is viewable in three formats, 1) a geospatial explicit format (ArcView 3.3) named GIS ArcView 3.3 Near GEM project, 2) a spreadsheet format (Excel 2002 and within ArcView) named GEM Nearshore Metadata Set, and 3) a ProCite database named GEM Nearshore Metadata References, which consists of references included in 1 and 2 above.  The ProCite database record number corresponds to the Excel Procite Number.  Reference Procite #163 for this literature's metadata.\n\n  The metadata are maintained in digital format (ArcView 3.3, Excel 2002, and Procite) and are available from the Alaska Science Center, USGS in Anchorage, Alaska.\n\n  For a detailed description of the three databases and the project, see \"Bodkin, J. L., and T. Dean.  2003.
