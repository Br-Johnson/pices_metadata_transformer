    "description": "This file contains the gridded analysis fields required by the Heat Budget Analysis Component. The data values from the heat budget retrievals are accumulated in the file and are accessed by the Heat Budget Product Component in order to produce the final mapped fields of the Heat Budget parameters. Daytime Longwave Radiation; Nighttime Longwave Radiation, and Absorbed Solar Radiation. At any given time, the file contains these data for the three most recent 24-hour periods.\n\n  The Office of Satellite Data Processing and Distribution (OSDPC) keeps this data for a month, then sends it to the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) for archiving.  For current data, contact John Sapper at OSDPC,  telephone 301-457-0914 ext.148, e-mail: john.sapper@noaa.gov.  For archived data contact Thomas Ross at NCDC, telephone 828-271-4499, e-mail: tom.ross@noaa.gov.",
