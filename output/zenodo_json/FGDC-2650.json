    "description": "A multi age-class model treating populations of both male and female fur seals was developed to examine the plausible long-term effect of their entanglement in discarded net debris.  The model is based on the data available on age-specific survival and fecundity including data supporting the assumption of density-dependent survival of pups on land and juveniles up to age 2 at sea.",
