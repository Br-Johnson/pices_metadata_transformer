    "description": "Data Type: Exxon Valdez Oil Spill;  Landcover for the EVOS spill affected area was extrapolated from DNR Alaska Land and Resource Mapping (ALARM) Program to provide general land cover maps at a scale of 1:250,000 for Prince  William Sound and the Kenai Peninsula. Both Landsat Imagery and Aerial photography were used to interpret vegetation types in 10 general classes. More detailed landcover is available for Afognak Island and PWS through the Chugach National Forest. The intended use was to provide landcover information for use in damage assessment, and restoration efforts.",
