    "description": "Surface nutrients [NO2 + NO3, Si(OH)4, PO4] concentrations are generally higher in winter than in summer in the Bering Sea basin, whereas concentrations in both seasons are nearly equal at water depths greater than 200-300 m.  Surface silicates are relatively low compared to other nutrients concentrations in summer, whereas a linear relationship is found between nitrite + nitrate and phosphate.",
