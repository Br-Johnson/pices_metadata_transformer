    "description": "Meteorological observations: every three-hours-interval, coving the whole course measurement of surface temperature, every hour-interval, covering the whole course Hydrographics cast.  At 22 stations, covering depths from the surface to usually 1500m.  Cast to 0.10, 20, 30, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 800, 1000, 1200 and 1500m, in length of wire paid out.  In deep cast each Nansen bottle carried out two protected thermometers and an unprotected thermometer.  At 22 stations and also each two stations between two successive stations of them, temperature and current measurement were carried with BT and GEK.\nAlso included Analyses of water samples, Radio-activity of sea water, Plankton sampling, Fish larvae tow, salmon gill-net operation, measurement of biological characters on fish caught by salmon gill-net fishing, measurement of light absorption of sea water in situ and measurement of total radioactivity of sea water.",
