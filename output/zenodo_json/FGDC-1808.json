    "description": "The NPZ model was designed to produce temporally and spatially explicit food source (Pseudocalanus stages) for larval pollock, and to be input to the pollock IBM.  This set of coupled (biological and physical) models was constructed to be used to examine hypotheses about pollock recruitment in the Shelikof Strait region.  \n\n[ Reference: PICES Scientific Report No. 18 2001, Proceedings of the PICES/CoML/IPRC Workshop on \"Impact of Climate Variability on Observation and Prediction of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes in the North Pacific\", http://www.pices.int/publications/scientific_reports/Report18/default.aspx. ]",
