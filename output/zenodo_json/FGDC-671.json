    "description": "Data Type: Exxon Valdez Oil Spill;  This dataset depicts the commercial fishing districts and subdistricts within the EVOS oil spill affected areas. The PWS commercial fishing districts and subdistricts were automated for the 1991-1992 management year. Subdistrict boundaries have been delineated based on the description in the \"1991-1992 Cook Inlet/Prince William Sound, Commercial Fishing Regulations\" booklet, and were verified by ADF&G, Cordova. This data intended use was for as a resource layer for oil spill damage assessment, response and habitat restoration purposes.",
