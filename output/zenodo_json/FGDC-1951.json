    "description": "You might not think of crabs as creatures that live on mountains. But in fact, a number of deep-sea crab species have made a niche for themselves on the sides of undersea volcanoes known as seamounts. Recently, with the help of a deep-diving submersible, Alaska scientists had a rare opportunity to study these crabs. Doug Schneider has more in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio.",

    "notes": "Purpose: Three years ago, crab researchers used the manned deep-diving submersible Alvin to take their first look at the Patton Seamount, a long-dormant undersea volcano in the Gulf of Alaska, about 300 miles south of Kodiak Island, Alaska. There, at depths ranging from a few hundred feet to more than a mile below the waves, they found ten species of crabs crawling about on the volcano's rocky slopes. They saw golden and scarlet king crabs, a small king crab relative known as paralomis, and a type of long-legged spider crab never before described in Alaska waters.\n\nBut what stood out, besides the variety of species, was that each kind of crab was very particular about where on the volcano it made its home. Brad Stevens is a biologist with the National Marine Fisheries Service in Kodiak, Alaska.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: None\n\nUse constraints: None\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
