    "description": "Data Type: Fish  ; Data depicts upper and lower extent of Anadromous fish streams throughout Alaska and is updated regularly. ARC/INFO software is used to manage and update data. This dataset is used to produce the Anadromous Waters Catalog for Alaska. Many other Alaska Resource Management agencies are known to use this dataset within their own agencies, utilizing that subset that pertains to the lands under their jurisdiction. The U.S. Forest Service is known to utilize this dataset and the EXXON Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council has as well. Additionally, stream arcs are available for the EVOS area.",
