    "description": "Oceanic dimethylsulfide (DMS) is the major natural source of sulfur to the atmosphere. The equatorial Pacific Ocean is a region of relatively high DMS emissions\nwhich persist throughout the year. Measurements from 11 cruises between 1982 and 1996 show that the mean surface seawater DMS concentration in this region\n(15°N to 15°S) is relatively constant both seasonally and interannually (2.7 ﾱ 0.7 nM). The large interannual variations in oceanic and atmospheric properties\nassociated with El Ni￱o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events appear to have little effect on the concentration of DMS in surface ocean waters.",
