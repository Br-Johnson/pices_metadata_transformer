    "description": "The eastern Bering Sea continental slope region contains many\n                        Groundfish species that are important to the Bering Sea ecosystem.\n                        Several studies have described the food habits of these species in\n                        the eastern Bering Sea shelf region, however few studies have\n                        been conducted for the slope region. Consequently, the food\n                        habits of the major Groundfish in this region are poorly understood.\n                        The focus of this study was to identify the trophic interactions of\n                        walleye Pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), Pacific cod (Gadus\n                        macrocephalus), Greenland turbot (Reinhardtius\n                        hippoglossoides), arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias),\n                        and flathead sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon) in the slope region\n                        of the eastern Bering Sea. Stomach contents of 1,089 walleye\n                        Pollock, 311 Pacific cod, 455 Greenland halibut, 282 arrowtooth\n                        flounder, and 366 flathead sole were examined. The general diet\n                        of each species is described and dietary variation due to predator\n                        size, depth, season, and latitude within the slope region are\n                        examined. Walleye Pollock are known to be the most important\n                        prey fish in the eastern Bering Sea shelf region. In the slope region,\n                        species from the families Bathylagidae and Myctophidae were\n                        found, in addition to Pollock, to be important forage fish of\n                        Groundfish predators.",
