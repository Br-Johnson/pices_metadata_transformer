    "description": "Steller sea lion populations in Western Alaska have declined steadily during the last 30 years. So few sea lions remain there today that federal officials have listed them as an endangered species. But this summer's count of sea lions along the state's coast has found cause for some optimism. Doug Schneider has more, in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio.",

    "notes": "Purpose: Federal biologists, using aerial photography, ships, and just plain walking the rocky, remote beaches from Prince William Sound west through the Aleutian Islandsﾗwhere Steller sea lions breed and haul outﾗfound a glimmer of hope in the nearly 30-year-long decline of the marine mammal. Biologists say that, overall, Steller sea lion numbers in Western Alaska grew by a modest 5.5 percent over the past two years. John Sease is a marine mammal biologist with the National Marine Fisheries Service in Seattle, Washington. He says the increase is a hopeful sign that sea lions, as well as the region's marine ecosystem, may be recovering.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: None\n\nUse constraints: None\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
