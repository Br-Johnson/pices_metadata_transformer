    "notes": "Purpose: Determination of the penetration of CO2 into the water column.\n\nSupplemental Information: Risk Justification: Custodian will be leaving soon and has a large quantity of data not secured in a regional data centre.\nRisk of Loss: High\nImpact Justification: Long term time series (more than 10 years)\nImpact of Loss: High\nRecommended Action: Obtain access to data and bring to archives\nAdditional Info: Freon data have been partly published; data will be made available after publication. PCO2 data (1973-1999) have been sent to the OSAP archive. Much of the productivity and chlorophyll data have been published, will be made available. DOC data are in press, and will be made available. DON data have been written up into a paper which has not yet been submitted for publication. TCO2 and Talkalinity profiles have been made available (1972-1997) and TCO2 and Talkalinity surface data (1972-1990) have been made available. C13 and O-18 data are custody of C.S. Wong.\nStorage Requirements: 50MB+unknown\n\nStatus: In work\n\nMaintenance frequency: None planned\n\nAccess constraints: May Be Private\n\nUse constraints: Temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and nutrient data are stored on the OSAP database, Departmentally accessible. Other data will be available after publication/quality checked (see Additional Information, below)\n\nDistribution liability: [unknown]\n\nFGDC metadata date: 20080211\n\nFGDC metadata standard: FGDC Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata\n\nFGDC metadata version: FGDC-STD-1998-1\n\nData quality - Logical consistency: Standardization of chemical instrumentation with known or commercially prepared standards.\nData quality - Completeness: Dataset Complications: Some DOC data are questionable.\n Meteorological data from NOAA buoy at Station P no longer freely available. Portable met. station on ship gives apparent measures of wind speed and direction for PCO2, must be corrected for ship`s heading, speed, etc.\nPCO2 originally measured by IR spectrophotometer, then by gas chromatograph, now using a non-dispersive IR analyzer.\nC13 and O-18 data are custody of C.S. Wong.\nElectronic Data Complications: Temperature, salinity, oxygen and nutrient data on IOS archived database are not quite conforming to IOS Header format, and are therefore difficult to search. All of the magtapes are older than their guaranteed physical lifespan. The last attempt to retrieve data from a magtape was successful (July 7, 2000).\nLineage - Process steps:\n  1. Unknown\n\nDistribution liability: [unknown]\nNon-digital ordering: Hardcopy Original Exists: Y\nHardcopy Locations: Joseph Linguanti, Rm 1246, IOS\nHardcopy Description: Various log books, cruise reports, and data sheets from Line P cruises, data sheets from individual analyses. Includes the weathership meteorological data.\nHardcopy Volume: 3 full file drawers\nPhysical Sample Exists: Y\nPhysical Sample Locations: C.S. Wong, Coolers, IOS Hangar Bldg.\nPhysical Sample Volume: C-13: about 2600; O-18: unknown number\nPhysical Sample Description: C-13 in seawater and O-18 in seawater in glass bottles.\nPhysical Sample Complications: Samples need to be kept refrigerated.\nFees: Ask Custodian\n\nFGDC metadata date: 20080211\nFGDC metadata standard: FGDC Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata (version: FGDC-STD-1998-1)",
