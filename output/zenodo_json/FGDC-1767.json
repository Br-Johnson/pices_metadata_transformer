    "description": "AVHRR SST data with 9-km resolution Pathfinder fields over the entire NEP.  These composites are created from 9 km Pathfinder AVHRR data available from the NOAA/NASA Oceans Pathfinder Page (http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/sst/).  The global images are subsetted to the NE Pacific Region and composite images are created by taking the warmest pixel from any image during a 9 day period. The images are 796 samples x 489 lines.  Composites were centered every 7 days for 1995 and 1996.  Pathfinder Images can be view online at http://coho.coas.oregonstate.edu/Gifs/logo.gif.

Data can be accessed through anonymous ftp at ftp://pisco.coas.oregonstate.edu/ebc.  \n\n[ Reference: PICES Scientific Report No. 18 2001, Proceedings of the PICES/CoML/IPRC Workshop on \"Impact of Climate Variability on Observation and Prediction of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes in the North Pacific\", http://www.pices.int/publications/scientific_reports/Report18/default.aspx. ]",
