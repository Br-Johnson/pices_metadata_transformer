    "description": "New carbonate data obtained on February-March and June-July cruises in the northeast Pacific during 1985 were utilized to describe processes affecting seasonal\nvariations of calcite and aragonite saturation. Large gradients in saturation state occur in the region between the Subtropical and the Subarctic Fronts in the\nnorth-south direction. These gradients are a function of large-scale mixing and biological processes in the North Pacific. The saturation values in the upper kilometer\nof the water column were observed to be significantly lower in winter than in summer. These decreases were due to a number of processes including: (i) the seasonal\ndecrease in the temperature of the water column; (ii) the seasonal increase in vertical mixing causing CO-enriched deep waters to be upwelled; and (iii) the seasonal\nenhancement of respiration over photosynthesis. Seasonal changes in total CO (TCO) concentrations appeared to have the greatest overall effect on the saturation\nstate. Aragonite dissolution rate experiments were conducted during the June-July cruise to provide an independent verification of the saturation calculations. In all\ncases, significant increases in aragonite dissolution were observed below the 100% saturation depth. In the northeast Pacific, shallow undersaturation horizons\nprovide for significant dissolution rates at depths below 400 m.",
