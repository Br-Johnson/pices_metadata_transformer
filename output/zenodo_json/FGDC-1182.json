    "description": "Using the TCO° results of Chen (1982a) obtained during a cruise in the northeast Pacific Ocean (June-July 1981), we have calculated preindustrial and 1981\ncalcite and aragonite saturation horizons for a transect along 150°W between Alaska and Hawaii. Uptake of excess CO by the oceans over the past 130 years has\nresulted in a significant change in the carbonate chemistry of the northeast Pacific Ocean. The results indicate an apparent reduction in the thickness of the\nsupersaturated lenses and an upward translation of the 100% saturation level by as much as 150 meters for calcite and 70 meters for aragonite in the cold-water\nregion north of the Subarctic Front.",
