    "description": "Health officials have consistently said a diet that includes fish such as salmon lowers the chance of heart disease and other ailments. And while that advice remains true today, scientists who just completed a study of contaminants in the world's salmon supply say not all salmon are safe to eat. Doug Schneider has more in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio.",

    "notes": "Purpose: It took only about two decades for countries like Chile and Norway to produce more farmed salmon than fishermen harvest from the wild. But it may have taken just a study published this month in the journal Science to make people put the brakes on eating farmed salmon.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: None\n\nUse constraints: None\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
