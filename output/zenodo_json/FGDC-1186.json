    "description": "New carbonate chemistry data obtained during a 1982 cruise have been combined with earlier GEOSECS and INDOPAC data to determine the degree of\naragonite saturation of surface and intermediate waters of the North Pacific. Large gradients in saturation state occur in the region of the Subarctic Front in the\nnorth-south direction and across the Subtropical Gyre in the east-west direction. These gradients are primarily due to the extensive mixing that occurs in the\nintermediate waters of the western North Pacific. The major variations in saturation state were primarily related to the carbonate ion concentration, which, in turn, is\nprimarily a function of mixing and biological processes. The present aragonite saturation depth at our northernmost station in the western North Pacific was\ncalculated to be within 120 m of the surface. The result was directly corroborated by observations of aragonite dissolution under in vitro conditions. Our calculations\nshow that one possible effect of fossil fuel-derived CO on the surface of the North Pacific will be a steady progression of undersaturation from the northern to\nsouthern and western areas, with the first sign of undersaturation possibly occurring as early as the second half of the next century.",
