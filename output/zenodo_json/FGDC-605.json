    "description": "Data Type: Birds;  This data set contains aerial survey data for Dusky Canada Geese started on the Copper River Delta in 1986. Since that time the same transects have been sampled yearly. Population index and breeding pair index were calculated from the data. Winter numbers are counted from aerial photography on their wintering grounds in the Pacific Northwest and annual nest surveys are conducted on the Copper River Delta, Gulf of Alaska and Middleton Island. The purpose of this data is to monitor Dusky Canada\nGoose populations as indicators of habitat health and more broadly as indicator of diversity.",
