    "description": "The interactions between hydrothermal circulation and large-scale geological and geophysical characteristics of the mid-ocean ridge\ncannot be ascertained without large-scale views of the pattern of hydrothermal venting. Such multi-ridge-segment surveys of venting are\naccomplished most efficiently by mapping the distribution and intensity of hydrothermal plumes. In November 1991, we mapped\nhydrothermal temperature () and light attenuation (c) anomalies above the East Pacific Rise (EPR) continuously from 8°40 to\n11°50N, a fast spreading ridge crest portion bisected by the Clipperton Transform Fault. Plume distributions show a precise correlation\nwith the distribution of active vents where video coverage of the axial caldera is exhaustive (9°09-54N). Elsewhere in the study area the\nsketchy knowledge of vent locations gleaned from scattered camera tows predicts only poorly the large-scale hydrothermal pattern\nrevealed by our plume studies. Plumes were most intense between 9°42 and 9°54N, directly over a March/April, 1991, seafloor\neruption. These plumes had exceptionally high c/ ratios compared to the rest of the study area; we suggest that the\nphase-separated gas-rich vent fluids discharging here fertilize an abundant population of bacteria. Hydrothermal plume distributions define\nthree categories: intense and continuous (8°48-8°58N, 9°29-10°01N and 11°05-11°27N), weak and discontinuous (8°58-9°29N)\nand negligible. The location of each category is virtually congruent with areas that are, respectively, magmatically robust, magmatically\nweak and magmatically starved, as inferred from previous measurements of axial bathymetric undulations, cross-axis inflation and magma\nchamber depth and continuity. This congruency implies a fine-scale spatial and temporal connection between magmatic fluctuations and\nhydrothermal venting. We thus speculate that, at least along this fast spreading section of the EPR, cyclic replenishment, eruption and\nfreezing of the thin axial melt lens exerts greater control over hydrothermal venting than the more enduring zones of crystal mush and hot\nrock. We found intense, and continuous, plumes along 33% of the surveyed ridge crest, an observation implying that any point on the\nridge is, on average, hydrothermally active one-third of the time. Combining this result with the 20% plume coverage found along the\nmedium-rate Juan de Fuca Ridge suggests that superfast (~150 mm/yr) spreading ridges should support vigorous venting along ~50% of\ntheir length, if spreading rate and along-axis plume coverage are linearly related.",
