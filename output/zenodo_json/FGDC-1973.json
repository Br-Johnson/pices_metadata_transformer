    "description": "The Bering Sea is one of the most productive oceans on earth. Scientists studying the Bering Sea say that's thanks to massive ocean eddies that behave like some sort of oceanic hurricane to bring life-sustaining nutrients up from the abyss. Doug Schneider has more in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio.",

    "notes": "Purpose: Much of the Bering Sea sits atop a broad, shallow shelf that's home to huge populations of fish, shellfish, marine mammals and seabirds. All told, the region is one of the most productive marine ecosystems anywhere on the planet. Phyllis Stabeno is an oceanographer with the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory in Seattle, Washington. She says the Bering Sea shelf is rich in nutrients that nourish an abundance of life there.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: None\n\nUse constraints: None\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
