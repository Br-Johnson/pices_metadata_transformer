    "description": "Data Type: Base Maps  ;Digital Line Graph (DLG) data are digital representations of cartographic information. DLG's of topographic and planimetric map features are derived from cartographic source materials using manual and automated digitizing methods. The USGS DLG data is classified as large (1:63,360) intermediate (1:1,000,000), and small (1:2,000,000) scale. Large-scale DLG data are available in nine categories: 1. hypsography, 2. hydrography, 3. vegetative surface cover, 4. non-vegetative features; 5. boundaries; 6. survey control markers; 7. transportation systems 8. manmade features, and 9. US Public Land Survey System, including township, range, and section information. Intermediate-scale DLG's are sold in five categories: 1. Public Land survey, 2. boundaries, 3. transportation 4. hydrography, and 5. hypsography. Small-scale DLG data are sold in three data categories: 1. boundaries; 2. transportation; 3. hydrography. All of these categories are also included on a 1:2,000,000-scale CD-ROM.",
