    "description": "This information package was produced for a NOAA/Institute of Marine Science workshop held on April 17-18 in Fairbanks, Alaska to demonstrate a strategic assessment information system for the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort Seas region. Conducted during the course of developing the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort Seas Strategic Assessment Data Atlas, the workshop was one of the first to promote the use of easily updateable electronic information systems such as NOAA's Cmas (Computer Mapping and Analysis System). An agenda, list of workshop participants, and description of NOAA's Living Marine Resources Assessment Program are included. \n\nNOAAServer Codes: [OL 72 55 -130 -168] ; nodateline obtain",
