    "description": "For the first 40 years of this century oceanographic studies in the Bering Sea were not systematic and were conducted in shallow water during the warm seasons.  Chemical investigations were started in connection with the Second International Polar Year and were restricted to measuring basic salinity and dissolved oxygen content in the western and northern areas of the Bering Sea (Ratmanov 1937a,b).",
