    "description": "Korea conducted commercial pelagic trawl operations for walleye Pollock in the Donut Hole area of the Bering Sea. Data recorded included water temperature, depth of fishing gear, towing time (hours), CPUE (tons/hour) and catch (tons). Biological samples of the catch included length frequency, sex ratio, and otolith samples for age determination.  Data were recorded on log sheets. Some of the log sheets have been keypunched. Commercial fishing operations in the Bering Sea ceased in 1993.",
