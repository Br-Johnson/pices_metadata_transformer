    "description": "Weather conditions in the Bering Sea, Aleutian Island, and Gulf of Alaska\n        region are described. Rules of thumb and other quick reference materials are\n        provided for use by operational forecasters. Background information is\n        included to enhance understanding of regional conditions. Case studies utilizing\n        satellite imagery are provided to examine a wide variety or regional weather\n        phenomena. Also included are relevant portions of the previously published\n        Forecasters Handbook for the Arctic (NEPRF TR 89-12, October 1989,\n        DTIC AD A238424), which did not address the Bering/Aleutian region\n        because of its size and complexity and because this present stand-alone\n        volume was intended.",
