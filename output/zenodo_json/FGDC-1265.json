    "description": "Scientists searching for dinosaurs in Alaska have found fossilized bones and even footprints left behind in ancient mud turned to stone. But nearly all of these discoveries were made on Alaska's North Slope. Late this summer, that all changed when a Dallas, Texas, paleontologist made a remarkable discovery in southwest Alaska. Doug Schneider has more in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio.",

    "notes": "Purpose: At first, it seemed like two years spent looking for evidence of dinosaurs in the Aniakchak National Monument, some 400 miles southwest of Anchorage, would go unrewarded. Tony Fiorillo, a paleontologist from the Dallas Museum of Natural History, had come to this remote corner of Alaska the year before, and had found nothing. And this time, after an incredibly scenic four-day raft trip through the heart of the monument, Fiorillo was again about to go home empty-handed.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required.\n\nUse constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
