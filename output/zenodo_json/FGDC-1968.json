    "description": "Womens Bay is a tiny ocean inlet just outside the small fishing town of Kodiak on Alaska's Kodiak Island. The bay is a favorite spot for locals to set their small, nylon-mesh crab trapsﾗcalled potsﾗin hopes of catching an easy crab dinner. As Doug Schneider reports in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio, a fair number of these crab pots are lost each year, but they don't necessarily stop catching crab.",

    "notes": "Purpose: Peter Cummiskey has for several years now been studying the red king crab that live on the bottom of Womens Bay, a small inlet on Kodiak Island, about 250 miles southwest of Anchorage, Alaska. He's glued to the shells of nearly 100 crab tiny transmitters that help him follow their movements on the bottom.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: None\n\nUse constraints: None\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
