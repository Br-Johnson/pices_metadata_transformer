    "description": "Data Type: Base Maps  ; Orthophotos are multicolored, distortion-free, photographic images. Unlike a normal aerial photograph, relief displacement in orthophotos has been removed so that all ground features are displayed in their true ground position. This allows for the direct measurement of distance, areas, angles, and positions. An orthophoto displays features that may be omitted or generalized on maps. They serve a variety of purposes, from interim maps to field references for earth science investigations and analysis. Scale is 1:63,360.",
