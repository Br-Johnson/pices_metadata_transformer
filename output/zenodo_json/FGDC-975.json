    "description": "We propose a model for the two-layer, mean transport within a branched, recirculating fjord system. The recirculation is para-meterized in\nterms of efflux/reflux coefficients at distinct mixing zones. The mass fluxes and efflux/reflux coefficients are determined from long-term\nsalinity and current meter observations. The model provides a way to predict the mean concentrations of pollutants introduced within the\nsystem. An application to Puget Sound shows that different discharge sites markedly affect the concentrations landward of the sites\nthemselves.",
