    "description": "As part of BASIS, the Ocean Carrying Capacity (OCC) Program participated in a large-scale salmon survey in the central and eastern Bering Sea during September through early October 2002.  The OCC Program chartered the fishing vessel Northwest Explorer to conduct the U.S. BASIS survey, and sent scientists onboard the Japanese BASIS vessel Kaiyo Maru and the Russian BASIS vessel TINRO.  Stock identification data were collected aboard all three vessels to assist in the construction of migratory models of salmon stocks.  Stomach and muscle tissue samples were collected for diet and lipid studies, and scales and otoliths were collected for age and detailed growth studies.  Seventeen immature chum salmon were tagged from the Kaiyo Maru and released with temperature and depth recording tags.",
