    "description": "The potential for competitive interaction between age-0 walleye pollock and capelin is currently being examined using data from a small-mesh trawl study conducted in the western Gulf of Alaska (GOA) during September 2000 and 2001.  \n\nTo measure ecological similarity among age-0 pollock and capelin, we are currently comparing geographic distributions, sizes, and diets.  Rigorous analysis of the data is planned, but preliminary results indicate very high similarity among these fishes:",

    "notes": "Purpose: The immediate objective is to determine how similar capelin are to age-0 pollock with regard to resource utilization so that we may begin to separate environmental effects from species interaction effects when considering geographic variation in predator-prey relations. Ultimately, our goal is to understand geographic variation in the suitability of coastal areas for the production of forage fishes.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: Unknown\n\nAccess constraints: None\n\nUse constraints: Contact the agency\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
