    "description": "The Pribilof Islands are located on the southeast Bering Sea shelf, near the shelf break.  They form a natural laboratory to study changes in climate.  Mean wind speed are weakest during July and typically out of the south.  From September through June winds are typically out of the north, with strongest winds occurring in winter.  Northerly winds results in the advections of ice towards the Pribilof Islands.  During most winters (~75%), ice reaches St. Paul Island.  The currents flow clockwise around the islands.  Sea surface temperatures are determined by the depth of the mixed layer.  North of the islands bottom temperature is determined by the previous winter's ice extent, while to the south bottom temperature is determined by advective processes.",
