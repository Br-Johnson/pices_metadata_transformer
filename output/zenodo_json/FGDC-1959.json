    "description": "As Alaska's cities get bigger, streams that once supported healthy runs of salmon now find themselves polluted, re-routed or otherwise altered. Chester Creek is one such stream. It flows through the center of Anchorage, Alaska's largest city. As Doug Schneider reports in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio, a scientist who studied the creek offers suggestions to save the creek's city salmon.",

    "notes": "Purpose: Photographs taken in the early 1900s show early day settlers harvesting salmon along Chester Creek, when it was still just a place in the vast Alaska wilderness. Today, Chester Creek is an urban salmon stream, set mid the hustle and bustle of Anchorage's 250,000 people. The creek begins high in the still undeveloped Chugach Mountains north of the city, but then quickly finds itself winding through the many neighborhoods, busy streets, and business parks of the city's midtown section.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: None\n\nUse constraints: None\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
