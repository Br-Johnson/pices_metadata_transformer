    "description": "Data Type: Ocean/Coasts ;   This data layer consists of all existing National Ocean Service (NOS) digital bathymetric data for Prince William Sound. NOS publishes digital bathymetric data in two forms: raw depths of all soundings from included bathymetric surveys; and \"gridded\" data (a summarization of the raw data information). This dataset contains the raw (ungridded) data converted to an ARC/INFO format. In addition to depth, the database contains information on survey number, date of survey, and limited bottom type information. Please refer to documentation for BATH_PL and BATH_LN for additional representations of bathymetric data.",
