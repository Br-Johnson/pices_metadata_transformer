    "description": "Two methods of indexing seasonal sea ice cover in the Bering Sea are evaluated and the consequences of sea ice variability to the ecosystem are discussed.  The residence time index (RTI) reflects the duration of ice each year in a gridded area while the seasonal sea ice index (SSII) is the southernmost position of sea ice along longitude 169 ' W.",
