    "description": "NOAA's National Data Buoy Center offers real-time and historical data\nfrom its 114 moored buoys and C-MAN (Coastal-Marine Automated Network)\nstations.  Data is transmitted hourly via the Geostationary\nOperational Environmental Satellites (GOES).\n\nAll stations measure wind speed and direction, wind gust, barometric\npressure and air temperature.  All buoys and some C-MAN stations\nmeasure sea surface temperature, wave height, and wave period.\nMonthly and annual climatic summary tables are available.\n\nStations are located throughout U.S. coastal waters including\nU.S. Atlantic coast, U.S. Pacific coast, Gulf of Alaska, Bering Sea,\nGulf of Mexico, Great Lakes and Hawaiian Islands.  Some stations are\nalso located in the western equatorial Pacific.\n\nReal-time data is available hourly.  After several days, data is\nquality-controlled and appended to daily data files.  An archive of\nmonthly data may also be accessed.  The following types of\nquality-controlled data are available: standard meteorological data,\nacoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) data, continuous winds data,\nspectral wave density data, spectral wave direction data, water level\ndata, and surface ocean current data.\n\nData is available through NDBC's WWW server using the station locator\nmap or the station ID list and search:\nhttp://seaboard.ndbc.noaa.gov\n\n\nTelnet, FTP and BBS service is also available:\n\n\"telnet://seaboard.ndbc.noaa.gov\"\n\nAnonymous FTP: ftp://seaboard.ndbc.noaa.gov\n\nand give email address as the password\n\nBBS phone number: 601-688-7938\nmodem settings: 8 data bits, no parity, and 1 stop bit, up to 28.8 Kbps\n\n[This summary was derived from the NDBC WWW pages and Earth System\nMonitor Vol. 5, No. 4, June 1995.]",
