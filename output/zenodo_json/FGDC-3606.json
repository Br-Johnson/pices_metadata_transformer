    "description": "A 20-m temperature-salinity profile is measured with a CTD each time plankton samples are collected.  The hydrographic structure of the surface water column used by juvenile salmon is thus monitored from its spring structure of a freshwater lens over a colder, more saline (denser) layer to a summer mixed structure throughout the period that juvenile salmon use the nearshore and strait habitats.",
