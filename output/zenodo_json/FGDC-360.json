    "description": "Indigenous peoples, including the Aleut, Inupiat, Ittelman, Koryak, Siberian Yupik, and Alaska Yupik, have coexisted with the Bering Sea for over eight thousand years, living successfully by their understanding of the winds, tides, currents, climate, and sea ice to harvest fish and wildlife. Such traditional knowledge and wisdom long ago taught Alaska Natives that in order to thrive they must assume an active stewardship role with the land, the sea, and all its creatures. Through time, the Bering Sea has come to mean everything to coastal peoples: it is the spiritual, cultural, physical, and economic centerpoint of their lives. In the most profound sense, this sea and the people who live along its coast have become one.  As outside organizations identify research priorities and management decisions are being made, it is critical that Bering Sea coastal people, whose lives remain wholly dependent on an abundant and diverse marine ecosystem, have an active role in understanding the problems and policies affecting them, and to\ndecided what steps they need to take. However, because the coastal residents are organized into community, sub-regional, and regional groups, there is no forum for collective decisions on an ecosystem-wide basis. The Council of Elders' leadership is\nnecessary to unify and prioritize the research goals of the region's Native peoples.\n\nAn NPMR project",
