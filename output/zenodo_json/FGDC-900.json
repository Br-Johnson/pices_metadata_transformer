The report summarizes related studies, such as tag-reporting rates, archival tags, and seamount tagging and addresses unknown factors behind variability in migration rates between years and between individuals.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: Unknown\n\nAccess constraints: None\n\nUse constraints: Contact the agency.\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
