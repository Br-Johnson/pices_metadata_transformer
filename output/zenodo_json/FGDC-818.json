    "description": "Data Type: Boundaries  ; The boundaries of the native regional corporations created by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) were derived in March 1992 from the 1990 TIGER database, prepared by the U.S. Census Bureau. Boundaries denote broad administrative limits used in the implementation of ANCSA. Many regional corporations retain land and resource holdings outside their respective ANCSA boundaries. Scale varies, recommend use at 1:1,000,000 or smaller.",
