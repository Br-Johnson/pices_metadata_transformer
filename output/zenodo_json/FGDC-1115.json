    "description": "After a swarm of earthquakes was detected on the CoAxial segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge in June-July 1993, the area was resurveyed with SeaBeam\nmultibeam sonar to search for depth changes associated with a submarine volcanic eruption. Quantitative comparison of the 1993 SeaBeam survey with surveys in\n1981/82 and 1991 shows one area of seafloor depth change (up to 29 m) between 1991-93 exactly where a pristine lava flow was discovered. In addition, two\nother depth anomalies (up to 37 m and 20 m) are identified between 1981-91, evidence that other recent eruptions have occurred along this spreading ridge\nsegment.",
