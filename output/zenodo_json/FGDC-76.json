    "description": "According to project of transport connection of USA and Russia across\n        Bering Strait the three designs are considered: dam, underground tunnel,\n        bridge. In all this cases a human influence on environment is great and must be\n        accounted for even now. The paper presents the estimated changes of ice\n        movements in Bering Strait. (DBO).",
