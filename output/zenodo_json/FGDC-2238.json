    "description": "The Halibut Commission extended its standard setline survey to the Bering Sea and Aleutians in 1997.  The survey design is a regular pattern of fixed stations on or near the slope, from  about 100 - 600 m depth.  The data are cached  by species plus length, sex and age for a sample of the halibut.",
