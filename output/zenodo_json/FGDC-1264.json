    "description": "Just off the coast of Alaska's Kodiak Island, the North Pacific Ocean quite literally drops into an abyss more than 10,000 feet deep. Rising up from the ocean floor are undersea mountains, called seamounts. One of the oldest and biggest is Patton seamount. As Doug Schneider reports in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio, scientists used\nthe submersible that found the Titanic to see the undersea mountain for the first time",
