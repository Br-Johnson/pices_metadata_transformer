    "description": "Data Type: Base Maps  ;This dataset contains the longitude lines which define the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Grid, zones 1-9, plus 59 and 60. Coordinates in the UTM projection are given in meters with numbers  increasing toward the east and north. zones 1 through 10. The system of rectangular plane coordinates is established by the National Geodetic Survey, National Ocean Service, for defining and stating the positions of points on the surface of the earth for the state of Alaska.",
