    "description": "The identification of North Pacific diatom assemblages in the Olkhovian\n     Formation of eastern Kamchatka and their correlation with the paleomagnetic\n     time scale allows accurate placement of the Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary in\n     the Kamchatka region. Analysis of the composition of the diatom flora makes\n     possible a paleogeographic reconstruction of the shelf region in the western\n     Bering Sea during the latest Pliocene and early Pleistocene.",
