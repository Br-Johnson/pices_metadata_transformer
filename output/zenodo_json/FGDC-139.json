    "description": "Author and title of this book: Elliot, Henry W., Report on the Seal Islands \n\n               Call number: C/ga E46 12799 \n\n               Number of books: 1 \n\n               This book is a part of the foreign meteorological data collection held by the NOAA Central Library in\n               Washington, DC. Information in this collection dates back to the 18th century for daily, monthly,\n               seasonal, and annual tabular summaries, and the 19th century for weather maps. These data are the\n               result of foreign exchange agreements, but the collection has not been updated since 1983. \n\n               In these summaries, definitions are: \n\n               1. Hourly/daily/monthly/seasonal/annual data -- values determined for each consecutive period, e.g.\n               monthly temperature data: Jan 1900, Feb 1900, etc. \n\n               2. Long-term data -- values determined over a period of years, e.g. long-term monthly temperature\n               data using Jan 1901, Jan 1902, etc. \n\n               This book contains tables of monthly surface weather for the Pribilof Islands in Alaska for various\n               periods between 1835 and 1876. \n\n               Tables include the following surface weather data for Saint Paul Island: \n\n               - monthly mean pressure, temperature, relative humidity, cloudiness, and prevailing direction of the\n               wind - monthly absolute maximum and minimum pressure, temperature, and relative humidity - monthly\n               range of pressure and temperature - monthly absolute maximum and minimum daily range of pressure\n               and temperature - monthly mean daily range of pressure and temperature - monthly maximum and\n               minimum mean temperature - monthly rainfall - monthly number of days with precipitation, hail,\n               snowfall, - monthly absolute maximum rainfall in 24 hours - monthly wind miles - monthly mean wind\n               velocity (includes hourly and daily) - monthly melted hail and snowfall. \n\n               Tables include the following biological data: \n\n               - weight, size, and growth of fur-seal from pup to adult \n\n               Tables include the following economic and commercial data: \n\n               - quarterly taxes paid to U.S.A. treasury by Alaska Commercial Company on seal skins - annual\n               number of days with fur seals taken for shipment from the Commander Islands - annual seal catch\n               from St. Paul and St. George Islands - annual probability of seals on St. George Island - annual\n               number of seals slain, date, character, and disposition of fur-seals - annual number of fur skins and\n               value from Pribylov Islands.",
