    "description": "This report references production data of nearshore bird communities and population abundance and species composition data of black oystercatchers (Haematopus bachmani), harlequin ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus), scoters (Melanitta spp.), nearshore bird communities from Semidi Islands, Alaska Peninsula.\n\n  The aforementioned data are referenced in citation: Hatch, S.A. and M.A. Hatch.  1979.  Studies of the breeding and population ecology of seabirds at Semidi Islands, Alaska: a summary of work completed in 1978.  Off. Biol. Serv.--Coastal Ecosystems, U.S. Fish and Wildl. Service, Anchorage, Alaska.\n\n  This literature was collected as part of a metadatabase that represents one or more nearshore resources (from physical attributes such as water and air, to birds and mammals).  Each entry is viewable in three formats, 1) a geospatial explicit format (ArcView 3.3) named GIS ArcView 3.3 Near GEM project, 2) a spreadsheet format (Excel 2002 and within ArcView) named GEM Nearshore Metadata Set, and 3) a ProCite database named GEM Nearshore Metadata References, which consists of references included in 1 and 2 above.  The ProCite database record number corresponds to the Excel Procite Number.  Reference Procite #437 for this literature's metadata.\n\n  The metadata are maintained in digital format (ArcView 3.3, Excel 2002, and Procite) and are available from the Alaska Science Center, USGS in Anchorage, Alaska.\n\n  For a detailed description of the three databases and the project, see \"Bodkin, J. L., and T. Dean.  2003.
