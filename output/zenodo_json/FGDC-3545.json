    "description": "This tape contains all sea surface temperatures (SST) derived from satellite data by NESDIS for a seven day period. File two is a direct copy of the disk data set NSS.PSATAV.SST.SVNDAY. The time period covered by tape includes the seven days previous to (but not including) the day on which the tape is produced (i.e. the date on the external label).\n\nThe tape is a 9-track, 1600 bpi, unlabeled, odd-parity, binary tape produced on an IBM 360/195 computer. The tape has two physical files, each ending with a physical end-of-file mark. The first file has only one record (physical) which contains information about the data on the tape and serves as a header file. The second file has 2080 physical records which contain the observation of SST. Tapes produced after 11/18/81 have 3000 physical records in the second file.\n\nThe Office of Satellite Data Processing and Distribution (OSDPC) keeps this data for a month, then sends it to the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) for archiving.  For current data, contact John Sapper at OSDPC,  telephone 301-457-0914 ext.148, e-mail: john.sapper@noaa.gov.  For archived data contact Thomas Ross at NCDC, telephone 828-271-4499, e-mail: tom.ross@noaa.gov.",
