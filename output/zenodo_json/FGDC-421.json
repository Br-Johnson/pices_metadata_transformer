    "description": "We will be studying links between physical forcing due to meteorological conditions and the temperature, salinity, velocity structure, nutrient and chlorophyll levels, and\nsinking of particulate matter. We plan to place two closely spaced moorings on the shelf of the Gulf of Alaska about 60 km offshore of Seward. One mooring will monitor temperature, salinity and horizontal velocities, and the other will monitor surface meteorological conditions, nitrate levels, sinking particulate matter, fluorescence and light levels. This study, in conjunction with the present GLOBEC monitoring study in the Gulf of Alaska, will permit us to understand the relation between physical forcing and higher trophic levels (marine mammals, birds, and fish).\n\nThis project also includes;\n\nSusan Henrichs \nUniversity of Alaska Fairbanks\n\nTerry Whitledge\nUniversity of Alaska Fairbanks\n\nAn NPMR project",
