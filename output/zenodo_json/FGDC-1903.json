    "description": "This data set contains the sedimentary denitrification rates from the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort Seas obtained during August-September 1992, and rates obtained in the Beaufort Sea off Pt. Barrow, Alaska, under late wintertime conditions (March 1993). The estimates made during August-September were based on both deployments of an automated in-situ benthic flux chamber tripod and on pore water chemical profiles from cores analyzed aboard the R/V Alpha Helix. Wintertime observations were obtained using scaled-down versions of the in-situ benthic flux chamber that were deployed through land-fast ice. The complete results are published in Devol, A.H., L.A. Codispoti, and J.P. Christensen, 1997. Summer and winter denitrification rates in western Arctic shelf sediments. Continental Shelf Research 17 (9): 1029-1050.
