    "description": "Data Type: Elevation;  Elevation (Slope and Aspect) for Prince William Sound at a scale of 1:63,360. The original source of the elevation data are from 100' contours depicted on 1:63,360 quads. The Chugach Forest Service geometronics group generated this information into Digital Elevation Model (DEM) format, and contracted to convert this into a grid format at 60 meter resolution. Slope and aspect have been generated from these resulting grids.",
