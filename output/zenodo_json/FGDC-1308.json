    "description": "Standard aerial survey techniques are not effective for estimating the number of seals hauled out on ice floes dispersed throughout glacial fjords.  It is estimated that as much as 20% of the Gulf of Alaska harbor seal stock may be using glacial ice habitats at various times of the year.  Following a   possible 80%- 85% decrease in the size of the Gulf of Alaska harbor seal population since 1970, there is a pressing need to accurately assess the abundance of harbor seals in glacial ice habitats.  The Polar Ecosystem Program is currently developing methods for accurately counting seals inhabiting the ice fields of tidewater glaciers.",
