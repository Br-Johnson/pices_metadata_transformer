    "description": "Subsurface mooring data from Gulf of Alaska: Station GLOBEC 10.  Data were collected from 1994 through 2004.  Sampled months varied through the years but were usually during May and September.  Salinity, temperature, and UV vector data were collected at various depths throughout the years using instruments such as MicroCAT and RCM-9.  172m was the maximum bottom depth.",
