    "description": "Concerns about possibly heavy impacts of bottom trawl fisheries on red king\n     crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus) pot fisheries in the eastern Bering Sea led\n     in 1987 to an emergency closure of trawling in an area of adult and juvenile\n     crab habitat. We examine the effectiveness of this bycatch refuge in protecting\n     and possibly enhancing the crab resource using three approaches. First,\n     bycatch of crab in trawl fisheries is a small proportion of total estimated\n     abundance throughout the southeastern Bering Sea but may be high relative\n     to stock abundance within the closed area and relative to annual crab landings;\n     recent regulations have diminished this apparent effect. Effects of direct\n     bycatch on the stock are obscured by lack of evidence on indirect effects of\n     trawling, including crushing of crab and degradation of juvenile habitat.\n     Second, surveys inside and outside the refuge before and after closure show\n     no significant changes in abundance of female and prerecruit male crab. Third,\n     important breeding and hatching grounds and juvenile habitat are not\n     protected by the refuge, leaving long-term stock renewal subject to trawl\n     impacts. We suggest that full consideration of the needs of all life history\n     stages could lead to a more effective refuge design.",
