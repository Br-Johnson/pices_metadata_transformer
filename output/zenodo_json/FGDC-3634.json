    "description": "This one-dimensional data set was indexed by pressure or depth, specifically, and collected by CTD from the hydrothermal venting area in the mid-latitudes of the North Pacific Ocean.  Depth range was 0 to 6047m deep.  There are currently 972 files available for plotting and download.  Data were collected by the PMEL Vents Program scientists and are available through PMEL EPIC website.\n\n  [PMEL - Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/), Vents Program (http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/vents)]",
