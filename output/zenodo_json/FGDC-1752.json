    "description": "Global elevation database gridded at 2-minute (latitude-longitude) resolution. The five major data sources were assembled into the single ETOPO2 2-minute data base without formal edge matching or other methods that alter the data as initially posted. Higher-resolution data take precedence: data derived from GLOBE mask all other data, Smith/Sandwell data come next, followed by IBCAO, with the 5-minute data filling any gaps. Five-minute data from DBDBV and ETOPO5 and 30-second data from GLOBE were regridded to 2 minute spacing by bicubic spline interpolation. IBCAO data were originally gridded in a polar stereographic projection; these data were interpolated along lines of constant latitude at 2 minute steps for every 2 minutes of latitude from 72Â° North to the pole.  ETOPO2 data available on CD-ROM.",
