    "notes": "Purpose: Biogeochemical flux in the deep ocean.\n\nSupplemental Information: Risk Justification: Custodian will be leaving soon and has a large quantity of data not secured in a regional data centre.\nRisk of Loss: High\nImpact Justification: Does not affect a wide variety of users.\nImpact of Loss: Low\nRecommended Action: Bring data to archives.\nAdditional Info: See also entry under, Northwest Pacific, 1991-1992 (GEMS); data from cruises to deploy and retrieve sediment traps.\nFour sediment traps were deployed; one did not work.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None planned\n\nAccess constraints: Private\n\nUse constraints: Data not yet published, collaborative.\n\nDistribution liability: [unknown]\n\nFGDC metadata date: 20080211\n\nFGDC metadata standard: FGDC Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata\n\nFGDC metadata version: FGDC-STD-1998-1\n\nNative data set environment: Expected Growth Rate: N/A\n\nData quality - Logical consistency: For C:N, biogenic silicate, CaCO3: subsamples of one sample, collected at P26, are analyzed with each set of data to check for continuity.  Zooplankton that likely swam into the trap are removed. Silicate concentrations are compared to prepared standards.\nData quality - Completeness: Electronic Data Complications: Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheets should be converted to Excel\nLineage - Process steps:\n  1. IOS and POI (Vladivostok)\n\nDistribution liability: [unknown]\nNon-digital ordering: Hardcopy Original Exists: Y\nHardcopy Locations: Janet Barwell-Clarke, Rm 1408, IOS\nHardcopy Description: Binder of data sheets\nHardcopy Volume: one 1 in. binder\nPhysical Sample Exists: Y\nPhysical Sample Locations: Janet Barwell-Clarke, Rm 1411, IOS\nPhysical Sample Volume: about one hundred.\nPhysical Sample Description: Vials of dried sediment in various formats: some are on filters, some are not.\nFees: Ask Custodian\n\nFGDC metadata date: 20080211\nFGDC metadata standard: FGDC Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata (version: FGDC-STD-1998-1)",
