    "description": "Subsurface mooring data from Alaska Stream, Aleutian Islands: Station Alaska Stream 1.  Data were collected from 1994 through 2004.  Sampled months varied through the years but were usually during May.  Temperature, UV vector, and velocity data were collected at various depths throughout the years using instruments such as ADCP and RCM-9.  986m was the maximum bottom depth.",
