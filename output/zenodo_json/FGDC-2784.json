    "description": "Between September 1989 and 1990, twenty-six current records were collected by instruments on eight moorings located in Pribilof and Zhemchug canyons, and at a site midway between these features. These records provide the first long-term Eulerian measurements from the slope and mid-slope of the eastern Bering Sea. Results from the current records, together with water property observations, permit a characterization of the Bering Slope Current. Moderate flow (~2 to 18 cm s) followed the Bathymetry toward the northwest and existed primarily in the upper 300 m. Wind and current energy increased in winter, but vector mean current did not increase at all sites. Wind forcing accounted for only a small fraction of the current fluctuations. At one mid-slope location in Pribilof Canyon, Bathymetry resulted in rectification of the strong daily tidal current. Estimates of heat and salt fluxes indicate some significant shoreward transport; however, this flux did not occur preferentially in the canyons.",
