    "description": "The extratropical Northern Oscillation Index (NOI), a new index of climate variability based on the difference in sea level pressure (SLP) anomalies at the North Pacific High (NPH) in the northeast Pacific (NEP) and at Darwin, Australia near a low pressure center, is introduced. Because of the role of these SLP centers in global atmospheric circulation patterns, the NOI reflects the variability in equatorial and extratropical teleconnections. It represents a wide range of local and remote climate signals, and summarizes the atmospheric forcing of climate change in the NEP and more generally the north Pacific-North American region.\n\nDownload or plot the NOI data from the PFEL Live Access Server (LAS) (http://www.pfeg.noaa.gov/products/las.html).\n\nThe manuscript describing these indices is in press (Schwing, F. B., T. Murphree and P. Green. A Climate Index for the Northeast Pacific. Progress in Oceanography).  \n\n[ Reference: PICES Scientific Report No. 18 2001, Proceedings of the PICES/CoML/IPRC Workshop on \"Impact of Climate Variability on Observation and Prediction of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes in the North Pacific\", http://www.pices.int/publications/scientific_reports/Report18/default.aspx. ]",
