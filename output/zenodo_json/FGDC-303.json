    "description": "Warm period circulation of water and fields of three-dimensional currents of Sakhalin Bay area assessed with the help of diagnostic model over the set density fields.  Assessments are made with 5 minute horizontal resolution for 8 vertical levels.  Density fields are calculated over historical temperature and salinity data collected by Far Eastern Regional Hydrometeorlogical Institute in 1951-1996.   Numerical model is based on primitive motion equation written in the orthogonal coordinate system with traditional (in such models) approximations.  Horizontal turbulent exchange is ignored.  Geometry of the bay and real seafloor topography are accounted.  The results of numerical experiments are illustrated by distribution of full current function, current velocity fields at different depths, and integral frontally indexes of water density structure in the area under study.",
