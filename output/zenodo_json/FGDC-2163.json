    "description": "This book references growth, population abundance and survival data of algal species (Fucus  distichus); population abundance data of algal species: Laminaria groenlandica, Laminaria saccharina, Laminaria yezoensis, and Zostera marina and invertebrate species: Dermasterias imbricata, Evasterias troschelii, Littorina scutulata, Littorina sitkana, Macoma balthica, Mytilus trossulus, Protothaca staminea, Pycnopodia helianthoides, and Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis; and production data of invertebrate species (Mytilus trossulus) from Island Flats, Mineral Creek Flats, Old Wharf, Perkin's Point, and Sawmill Spit, Prince William Sound, Alaska.\n\n  The aforementioned data are referenced in citation: Feder, H. M. and G. E. Keiser. 1980. Intertidal Biology.  In Port Valdez, Alaska: Environmental Studies, 1976-1979. Institute of Marine Science, University of Alaska, Fairbanks. Chapter 8. pp. 145-233.\n\n  This literature was collected as part of a metadatabase that represents one or more nearshore resources (from physical attributes such as water and air, to birds and mammals).  Each entry is viewable in three formats, 1) a geospatial explicit format (ArcView 3.3) named GIS ArcView 3.3 Near GEM project, 2) a spreadsheet format (Excel 2002 and within ArcView) named GEM Nearshore Metadata Set, and 3) a ProCite database named GEM Nearshore Metadata References, which consists of references included in 1 and 2 above.  The ProCite database record number corresponds to the Excel Procite Number.  Reference Procite #320 for this literature's metadata.\n\n  The metadata are maintained in digital format (ArcView 3.3, Excel 2002, and Procite) and are available from the Alaska Science Center, USGS in Anchorage, Alaska.\n\n  For a detailed description of the three databases and the project, see \"Bodkin, J. L., and T. Dean.  2003.
