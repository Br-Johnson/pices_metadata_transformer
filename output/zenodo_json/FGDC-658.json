    "description": "Data Type: Exxon Valdez Oil Spill;  This is a series of four seasonal maps with a broad overview of the environmentally sensitive resources of Prince William Sound that would receive priority attention during oil spill planning and response. Resources depicted were chosen on the basis of high sensitivity to spilled oil, high vulnerability to oil spills or special management status. Also a series of 42 maps at 1:63360 with similar data.",
