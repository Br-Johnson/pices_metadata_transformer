    "description": "Because of the Bering Sea ecosystem's economic importance and recent\nchanges that have occurred there, the region has become more and more a focus\nfor scientific research. In order to be able to conduct effective research, the National\nResearch Council, as part of their 1996 evaluation of scientific knowledge of the\nBering Sea ecosystem, identified the need for a comprehensive catalog, inventory, or\natlas of historical databases pertaining to the Bering Sea ecosystem. In reaction to\nthis need, we began developing the Bering Sea Ecosystem Biophysical Metadatabase\nin 1997 under a three-year NOAA research grant. The metadatabase, accessible at\nhttp://www.pmel.noaa.gov/bering/mdb, now contains over 1250 records. However,\nit is still a work in progress. There remain historical data to catalog, and it is vitally\nimportant to include results from new programs such as the North Pacific Marine\nResearch program (NPMR). We will work directly with NPMR scientists to achieve\ntimely archival of program Metadata. Also, we will enlarge the metadatabase with\nadditional information, with a particular focus on the western Bering Sea.\n\nFor more information:\n\nhttp://www2.sfos.uaf.edu:8080/npmr/projects/data/11/abstract11.html\n\nhttp://www2.sfos.uaf.edu:8080/npmr/projects/data/11/project11.html\n\n\nThis project is also includes;\n\nDr. Bernard Megrey \nAlaska Fisheries Science Center, NOAA \n7600 Sand Point Way NE\nSeattle, WA 98115\n(206) 526-4147\nbmegrey@afsc.noaa.gov\n\nAn NPMR project",
