    "description": "Hokkaido University has 5 sampling lines (155°E, 170°E, 175°30ﾒE, 180°, 145°W longitude) in the North Pacific Ocean.  The 180°-line is the longest time-series of the oceanographic and fisheries data collected by T/S Oshoro-Maru.  Data includes zooplankton samples collected at stations between 37° and 51°N in the summers (mid-June) of 1979-2000 and hydrographic data (temperature, salinity and Secchi depth).  The 180° time-series data sets have been published in the Data Record of Oceanographic Observation and Exploratory Fisheries Nos. 23-43 (Hokkaido University 1980-2000).  \n\n\n[ Reference: PICES Scientific Report No. 18 2001, Proceedings of the PICES/CoML/IPRC Workshop on \"Impact of Climate Variability on Observation and Prediction of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes in the North Pacific\", http://www.pices.int/publications/scientific_reports/Report18/default.aspx. ]",
