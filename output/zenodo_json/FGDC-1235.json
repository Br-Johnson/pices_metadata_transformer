    "description": "The recent development of sophisticated sonar systems for seafloor imaging allows analyses of terrain beyond simple bathymetric mapping. The SEABEAM\nmultibeam sonar system produces full-coverage 12-kHz soundings, and much of the Gorda Ridge has been surveyed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration and the U.S. Navy. Complete-coverage digital bathymetry provides the basic data for statistical modeling of seafloor roughness through spectral and\nfractal mathematical techniques. In addition to soundings, the SEABEAM system can provide fundamental information about bottom properties through evaluation of\nthe backscattered acoustical signal. Side-scan sonar systems allow more detailed observations of the variability of acoustic properties. Available side-scan sonar\ndata range from the broad (60-km swath) complete coverage of the GLORIA system collected by the U.S. Geological Survey to 10-km swath SeaMARC II and\n5- to 0.5-km-wide SeaMARC I imaging, which produces pixel spot sizes of as little as 25 cm. The full-coverage, digital nature of these data allows the application\nof terrain classification techniques developed for satellite imagery. The validity of remote-imaging techniques can only be evaluated when compared to observational\nground truth. A recently developed technique for geological mapping from bottom photography facilitates such comparisons.",
