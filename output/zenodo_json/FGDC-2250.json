    "description": "The BCB Atlas is a regional strategic assessment publication that presents maps of important features and activities in the U.S. coastal region off Arctic Alaska.  It contains information on important biological features, and has maps portraying spatial and temporal attributes (often by life stage) of  important living marine resources.  Seventy-seven (77) separate species or species groups are portrayed geographically with accompanying text.  Other features mapped include: physical and biological environments, economic activities, jurisdictions, etc.",

    "notes": "Purpose: This atlas represents a compendium of Arctic marine information (through 1986) from a variety of sources.  As a publication, it is a static document that portrays information about living marine resources.  Because resources discussed are dynamic, a computer-based electronic atlas with extensive graphics capability is being implemented to allow rapid information updating and access.\n\nStatus: In Progress\n\nMaintenance frequency: Unknown\n\nAccess constraints: None\n\nUse constraints: None\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
