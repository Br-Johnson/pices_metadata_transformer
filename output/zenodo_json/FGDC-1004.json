    "description": "Data Set: An extensive deep-two survey around an active submarine vent field was conducted. Emissions from the 10-kilometer-long vent field\nformed a nearly isopycnal plume about 250 meters thick and elongated in the direction of the local net current. Net export of hydrothermal\ndischarge from both point and diffuse sources was estimated from the advective transport of the plume; the heat flux was 5.8 ﾱ 2.9 ￗ 10\nwatts and the dissolved manganese flux was 0.2 ﾱ 0.1 moles per second. Flux measurements of this type could be expanded to\nencompass entire ridge segments, allowing comparison with theoretical thermal and chemical process models on a common spatial scale.",
