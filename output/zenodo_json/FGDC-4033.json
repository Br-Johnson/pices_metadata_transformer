The present JCOPE system has achieved near operational forecast using almost all available data obtained from satellites, ARGO floats and ships. The routine prediction of oceanic variation, combining with in-situ verification of the results, will significantly contribute to improve atmosphere-ocean models for prediction of longer-term climate change.",
