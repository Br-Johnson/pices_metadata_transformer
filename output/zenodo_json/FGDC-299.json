    "description": "With SST anomalies (seasonal deviations) decomposed into the Complex EOFs for 1950-1980, the anomaly waves are detected moving in the extratropical North Pacific as response patterns corresponding particularly to El Nino signal propagation in the northeast and central Pacific.  The northwest Pacific mode points to the local Kuroshio/Oyashio frontal area characterized by the intensive ocean/atmosphere interaction.  The moving wave patterns are emphasized for specific winter season as opposed to the \"round-year\" seasonal anomalies represented by both moving and standing waves.",
