    "description": "Morphologic studies of an oceanic transform, the Blanco Transform Fault Zone (BTFZ), have shown it to consist of a series of extensional basins that offset the\nmajor strike-slip faults. The largest of the extensional basins, the Cascadia Depression, effectively divides the transform into a northwest segment, composed of\nseveral relatively short strike-slip faults, and a southeast segment dominated by fewer, longer faults. The regional seismicity distribution (m  4.0) and\nfrequency-magnitude relationships (b-values) of the BTFZ show that the largest magnitude events are located on the southeast segment. Furthermore, estimates of\nthe cumulative seismic moment release and seismic moment release rate along the southeast segment are significantly greater than that of the northwest segment.\nThese observations suggest that slip along the southeast segment is accommodated by a greater number of large magnitude earthquakes. Comparison of the seismic\nmoment rate, derived from empirical estimates, with the seismic moment rate determined from plate motion constraints suggests a difference in the seismic coupling\nstrength between the segments. This difference in coupling may partially explain the disparity in earthquake size distribution. However, the results appear to confirm\nthe relation between earthquake size and fault length, observed along continental strike-slip faults, for this oceanic transform.",
