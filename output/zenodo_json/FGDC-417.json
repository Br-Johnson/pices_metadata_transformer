    "description": "Investigation in the Bering Sea were carried out by the Pacific Research Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography (TINRO) from an ecological point of view.  The composition, structure, interannual dynamics and function of the pelagic and demersal communities were studied on a macroecosystem scale.  This work was primarily undertaken by the Laboratory of Applied Biocenology (I.e. ecology) and the Laboratory of Research of Plankton of Far-Eastern Seas.  Ecosystem investigations were included as part of fishery research and were supported by a research vessel.  The mission of the first expedition in 1983 was conducted until 1985, with pelagic surveys starting after 1986.  Eleven expeditions have been completed.",
