    "description": "Almost anyone who loves mushrooms has probably wondered what it would be like to pick them in the wild. The best way to start is to go with people who know what they're\ndoing. As science writer Sonya Senkowsky reports in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio, Alaska mushroom hunters have begun harvesting morels, a type of mushroom that grows especially well in burned forests.",

    "notes": "Purpose: Two years ago, Eklutna, Alaska, landowner Larry Traw had a series of nasty surprises. First, a wildfire burned some 400 acres of forest around his home. Then, state and\nfederal officials tried to hold him responsible for the blaze, saying it most likely started when he was burning brush in his backyard. Finally, he was slapped with a one-million-dollar fire-fighting bill, the largest ever charged to a private andowner.\n\nCould there possibly be a bright side to this story? Traw says there was. For at the same time his legal battle was beginning, popping up among the ash was another surprise, this one much nicer: a fresh crop of Alaska morels.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required.\n\nUse constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
