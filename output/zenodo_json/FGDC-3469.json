    "description": "This report references diet, health measures, and oil contaminant data of invertebrate species (Mytilus trossulus) from Barnes Cove, Bay of Isles, Bligh Island, Chenega Island, Eleanor Island, Foul Bay, Herring Bay, Latouche Island, and Olsen Bay, Prince William Sound, Alaska.\n\n  The aforementioned data are referenced in citation: Thomas, R. E., C. Brodersen, M. G. Carls, M. M. Babcock, and S. D. Rice. 1999. Lack of physiological responses to hydrocarbon accumulation by Mytilus trossulus after 3-4 years chronic exposure to spilled Exxon Valdez crude oil in Prince William Sound.

Physiol. 122C(1): 153-163.\n\n  This literature was collected as part of a metadatabase that represents one or more nearshore resources (from physical attributes such as water and air, to birds and mammals).  Each entry is viewable in three formats, 1) a geospatial explicit format (ArcView 3.3) named GIS ArcView 3.3 Near GEM project, 2) a spreadsheet format (Excel 2002 and within ArcView) named GEM Nearshore Metadata Set, and 3) a ProCite database named GEM Nearshore Metadata References, which consists of references included in 1 and 2 above.  The ProCite database record number corresponds to the Excel Procite Number.  Reference Procite #975 for this literature's metadata.\n\n  The metadata are maintained in digital format (ArcView 3.3, Excel 2002, and Procite) and are available from the Alaska Science Center, USGS in Anchorage, Alaska.\n\n  For a detailed description of the three databases and the project, see \"Bodkin, J.
