    "description": "Salinity stratification is critical to the vertical mixing and circulation of the high-latitude seas.  The importance of fresh water to high-latitude mixing processes follows from the properties of the equation of state for sea water at low temperature (thermal expansion coefficient for sea water at low temperature is small).  Therefore, the introduction of small amounts of fresh water can prevent vertical mixing even in the case of substantial surface cooling.",
