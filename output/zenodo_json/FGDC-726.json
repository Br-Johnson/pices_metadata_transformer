    "description": "Data Type: Multi-Resources;   The Chugach National Forest has for the past five years been working on various multi-resource inventories across National Forest lands in the Chugach National Forest. These inventories are in various stages of completion. An integrated ecological inventory to include National Forest lands on the Kenai Peninsula is presently underway. Data will be automated in GIS format for use in the Chugach Forest Plan revision process. This data set's intended use is for baseline data support for project oriented projects being conducted within the forest on the Kenai Peninsula. The Copper River Delta integrated inventory includes landform, soils, and vegetation communities is almost complete. It will be entered into the Chugach GIS system in ARC/INFO format. A general lands system inventory scheduled for completion in 1995 for the entire forest is presently being conducted and includes landforms and sub group soils mapping.",
