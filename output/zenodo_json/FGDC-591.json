    "description": "Data Type: Base Maps;  This data layer contains the boundaries of the 1:250,000 scale USGS quadrangles for the Prince William Sound - Copper River ecosystem. Pacific GIS also reselected each quad out of the master coverage to be used for digitizing in UTM coordinates. Additional grid data layers covering the Prince William Sound - Copper River basin ecosystem include a 1:63,360 scale USGS quadrangle coverage (quad63), a latitude and longitude coverage (lat_long), a township boundary coverage (townships), and a section boundary coverage (sections).",
