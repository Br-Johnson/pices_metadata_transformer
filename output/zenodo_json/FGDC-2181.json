    "description": "These reports reference oil contaminant and survival data of nearshore bird communities and survival data of black oystercatchers (Haematopus bachmani), goldeneyes (Bucephala islandica), harlequin ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus), and scoters (Melanitta spp.) from the Gulf of Alaska.\n\n  The aforementioned data are referenced in citation: Ford, R.G., M.L. Bonnell, D.H. Varoujean, G.W. Page, and H.R. Carter.  1996.  Total direct mortality of seabirds from the Exxon Valdez oil spill. In Rice, S.D., Spies, R.B., Wolfe, D.A. and Wright, B.A. (eds.)  Proceedings of the Exxon Valdez oil spill symposium, Bethesda, Md. and Ford, R.G., M.L. Bonnell, D.H. Varoujean, G.W. Page, H.R. Carter, B.E. Sharp, D. Heinemann, and J.L. Casey. Total direct mortality of seabirds from the Exxon Valdez oil spill.  American Fisheries Symposium 18: 684-711.\n\n  This literature was collected as part of a metadatabase that represents one or more nearshore resources (from physical attributes such as water and air, to birds and mammals).  Each entry is viewable in three formats, 1) a geospatial explicit format (ArcView 3.3) named GIS ArcView 3.3 Near GEM project, 2) a spreadsheet format (Excel 2002 and within ArcView) named GEM Nearshore Metadata Set, and 3) a ProCite database named GEM Nearshore Metadata References, which consists of references included in 1 and 2 above.  The ProCite database record number corresponds to the Excel Procite Number.  Reference Procite #341 for this literature's metadata.\n\n  The metadata are maintained in digital format (ArcView 3.3, Excel 2002, and Procite) and are available from the Alaska Science Center, USGS in Anchorage, Alaska.\n\n  For a detailed description of the three databases and the project, see \"Bodkin, J. L., and T. Dean.  2003.
