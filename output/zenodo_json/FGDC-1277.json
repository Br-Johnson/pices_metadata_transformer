    "description": "Finding a suitable mate is a challenge for just about every species. If you're a seabird like the crested auklet, finding a partner may be as simple as being good at keeping\nparasites off your body. Doug Schneider has more, in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio.",

    "notes": "Purpose: Alaska's Aleutian Islands stand like lush, green sentinels overlooking the Bering Sea. Their massive cliffs are an oasis amid a vast, lonely ocean, and are home to a variety\nof seabirds. The most recognizable is probably the tufted puffin. These islands also are home to colonies of shearwaters, kittiwakes, and crested auklets. At seven inches in length, crested auklets aren't big. But what they lack in size, they more than make up for in number. Hector Douglas is a graduate student who studies crested auklets at the\nUniversity of Alaska Fairbanks.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required.\n\nUse constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
