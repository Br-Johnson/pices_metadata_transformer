    "description": "The standard model for sea ice dynamics treats the ice pack as a viscoﾖplastic\nmaterial that flows plastically under typical stress conditions but behaves as a linear\nviscous fluid where strain rates are small and the ice becomes nearly rigid. Because of\nlarge viscosities in these regions, implicit numerical methods are necessary for time\nsteps larger than a few seconds. Current solution methods for these equations use\niterative relaxation methods, which are time consuming, scale poorly with mesh\nresolution, and are not well adapted to parallel computation. To remedy this, the\nauthors developed and tested two separate methods. First, by demonstrating that the\nviscous-plastic rheology can be represented by a symmetric, negative definite matrix\noperator, the much faster and better behaved preconditioned conjugate gradient\nmethod was implemented. Second, realizing that only the response of the ice on\ntimescales associated with wind forcing need be accurately resolved, the model was\nmodified so that it reduces to the viscous-plastic model at these timescales, whereas\nat shorter timescales the adjustment process takes place by a numerically more\nefficient elastic wave mechanism. This modification leads to a fully explicit numerical\nscheme that further improves the modelﾒs computational efficiency and is a great\nadvantage for implementations on parallel machines.\n\nFurthermore, it is observed that the standard viscous-plastic model has poor\ndynamic response to forcing on a daily timescale, given the standard time step (1 day)\nused by the ice modeling community. In contrast, the explicit discretization of the\nelastic wave mechanism allows the elastic-viscous-plastic model to capture the ice\nresponse to variations in the imposed stress more accurately. Thus, the\nelastic-viscous-plastic model provides more accurate results for shorter timescales\nassociated with physical forcing, reproduces viscous-plastic model behavior on longer\ntimescales, and is computationally more efficient overall.",
