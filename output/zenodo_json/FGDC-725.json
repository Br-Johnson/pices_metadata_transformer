The database contains data at two scales, 1:250,000 and 1:63360. Areas of high interest mapped at the 1:63360 scale, are primarily state owned lands in the central basin and along major roads. Geology and vegetation (minimum unit 20-40 acres) are the main themes mapped at the detailed scale. Other data topics, trails, roads, recreation use, political and administrative use, oil and gas resources, minerals, infrastructure, hydrology, historical and archeological sites, general geology, and geologic constraints.
