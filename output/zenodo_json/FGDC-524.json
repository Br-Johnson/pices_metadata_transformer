    "description": "The Bering Sea responds strongly to major changes in atmospheric forcing. This response is vividly illustrated by the record warm sea surface temperatures that occurred in summer 1997, and the strong mixing in spring 1998. The spring 1998 mixing was due to intense storminess after nearly a decade of reduced storm activity. A large part of this variability is associated with large-scale atmospheric teleconnection modes that fluctuate on monthly to decadal time scales. The modes of particular importance to the Bering Sea during the cool season are the Pacific-North American pattern (PNA) and the Arctic  Oscillation (AO). The AO is receiving great interest because its persistent phase since about 1989 may be related to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases. Less work has been done on the atmospheric variability during the biologically active warm season, but one mode, the North Pacific pattern (NP), seems to be\nespecially important to the Bering Sea. The NP undergoes considerable decadal variability and appears to be linked to ENSO.   The goal of our work is to establish the dynamic relationships between the large-scale changes in the climate system (as\nencapsulated by the teleconnection indices) and the high-frequency, local forcing of the Bering Sea, especially with regard to sea ice, ocean transport and mixed-layer ocean\nprocesses. This research relies upon the daily data available from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis for the period 1958 to the present. Our work will reveal the extent to which air-sea interactions in the Bering Sea are predictable, and the probable changes in these\nair-sea interactions that accompany shifts in the climate system.  Our results will provide a firm climate context for the further study of historical changes in biological populations.\n\nAn NPMR project",
