    "description": "This report references diet data of black oystercatchers (Haematopus bachmani), fish species: Ammodytes hexapterus, Clupea pallasi, and Mallotus vullosus, invertebrate species: Mytilus trossulus and Protothaca  staminea, nearshore bird communities, and scoters (Melanitta spp.); production data of black oystercatchers (Haematopus bachmani) and nearshore bird communities; and species composition data of black oystercatchers (Haematopus bachmani) and nearshore bird communities from Chisik Island and Kachemak Bay, Cook Inlet, Middleton Island, Gulf of Alaska, and Chiniak Bay, Izhut Bay, Kiliuda Bay, Kodiak Island, and Sitkalidak Strait, Alaska.\n\n  The aforementioned data are referenced in citation: Lensink, C.J., P.J. Gould, and G.A. Sanger.  1979.  Population dynamics and trophic relationships of marine birds in the Gulf of Alaska.  In: Environmental assessment of the Alaskan Continental shelf. Annual reports of Principal investigators for the year ending March 1979, Volume 2, Receptors _ Birds., p. 7-20.\n\n  This literature was collected as part of a metadatabase that represents one or more nearshore resources (from physical attributes such as water and air, to birds and mammals).  Each entry is viewable in three formats, 1) a geospatial explicit format (ArcView 3.3) named GIS ArcView 3.3 Near GEM project, 2) a spreadsheet format (Excel 2002 and within ArcView) named GEM Nearshore Metadata Set, and 3) a ProCite database named GEM Nearshore Metadata References, which consists of references included in 1 and 2 above.  The ProCite database record number corresponds to the Excel Procite Number.  Reference Procite #605 for this literature's metadata.\n\n  The metadata are maintained in digital format (ArcView 3.3, Excel 2002, and Procite) and are available from the Alaska Science Center, USGS in Anchorage, Alaska.\n\n  For a detailed description of the three databases and the project, see \"Bodkin, J. L., and T. Dean.  2003.  Alternative Sampling Designs for Nearshore Monitoring (Gulf Ecosystem Monitoring and Research Project G-030687), US Geological Survey, Alaska Science Center, Anchorage, Alaska.\" available on-line at http://www.evostc.state.ak.us/pdf/GEM_final_reports/030687.pdf.",
