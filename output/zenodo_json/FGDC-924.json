    "description": "Current moorings were deployed on the continental shelf at 13 locations in the northwest Gulf of Alaska. They measured the Alaska Coastal Current at three positions along the coast during April-October 1991. The strongest currents were in the confined region of Shelikof Strait. Mean daily transport was as large as 2.5 ￗ 10 m s. Mean transport over the 6-month period ranged from 0.85 ￗ 10 ms at the easternmost line (off Gore Point) to 0.64 ￗ 10 m s at the westernmost section (Shelikof Strait), indicating significant transport to the south of Kodiak Island. The transports were well correlated (r > 0.8) and in phase with each other and were also correlated with wind (r ~ 0.6). Data suggest that in Shelikof Strait and off Gore Point, baroclinic flow is ~75% and <40%, respectively, of total transport.",
