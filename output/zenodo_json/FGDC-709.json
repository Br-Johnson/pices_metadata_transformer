    "description": "Data Type: Mammals;   This data set consists of radio telemetry data from radio collared grey wolves on the Copper River Delta. This data is used to determine pack territory boundaries, survival and dispersal. The purpose of this data set is to monitor population change in terms of size, recruitment, survival, dispersal, and mortality over several years to better understand wolf population dynamics.",
