    "description": "This journal article references diversity, population abundance, and species richness data of invertebrate communities; oil contaminant data of sediment; and population abundance data of invertebrate species: Littorina sitkana, Littorina spp., and Macoma balthica from Bainbridge Bright, Bass Harbor, Bay of Isles, Block Island, Crab Bay, Crafton Island, Hanning Bay, Herring Bay, Hogg Bay, Ingot Island, Mussel Beach, Northwest Bay, Outside Bay, Port Chalmers, Sheep Bay, Shelter Bay, Sleepy Bay, and Snug Harbor, Prince William Sound, Alaska.\n\n  The aforementioned data are referenced in citation: Driskell, W. B., A. K. Fukuyama, J. P. Houghton, D. C. Lees, A. J. Mearns, and G. Shigenaka.  1996.  Recovery of Prince William Sound intertidal infauna from Exxon Valdez oiling and shoreline treatments, 1989 through 1992.   American Fisheries Symposium 18: 362-378.\n\n  This literature was collected as part of a metadatabase that represents one or more nearshore resources (from physical attributes such as water and air, to birds and mammals).  Each entry is viewable in three formats, 1) a geospatial explicit format (ArcView 3.3) named GIS ArcView 3.3 Near GEM project, 2) a spreadsheet format (Excel 2002 and within ArcView) named GEM Nearshore Metadata Set, and 3) a ProCite database named GEM Nearshore Metadata References, which consists of references included in 1 and 2 above.  The ProCite database record number corresponds to the Excel Procite Number.  Reference Procite #264 for this literature's metadata.\n\n  The metadata are maintained in digital format (ArcView 3.3, Excel 2002, and Procite) and are available from the Alaska Science Center, USGS in Anchorage, Alaska.\n\n  For a detailed description of the three databases and the project, see \"Bodkin, J. L., and T. Dean.  2003.
