    "description": "Bucket samples for temperature (thermometer) and salinity (hydrometer) from manned and unmanned British Columbia Coastal Lighthouse Stations. Individual daily measurements have relatively low accuracy and resolution (esp. salinity). Monthly averages are usually used. Some manned stations are being discontinued and observations are being automated. Near real time data available from Amphitrite Point (see plot of current conditions and anomalies on the IOS web site. Other stations may become available in real-time as lighthouse automation continues.  Data Sets can be obtained directly at http://www-sci.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/osap/data/SearchTools/Searchlighthouse_e.htm.  \n[ A TCODE project ]",
