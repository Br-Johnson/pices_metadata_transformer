In Reanalysis-2, global analyses are made using an updated forecast model, updated data assimilation system, improved diagnostic outputs and fixes for the known processing problems of N/N Reanalysis.  \n\nPlots, data, and points of contact are listed at http://nomad2.ncep.noaa.gov/ncep_data/index.html.  \n\n[ Reference: PICES Scientific Report No. 18 2001, Proceedings of the PICES/CoML/IPRC Workshop on \"Impact of Climate Variability on Observation and Prediction of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes in the North Pacific\", http://www.pices.int/publications/scientific_reports/Report18/default.aspx. ]",
