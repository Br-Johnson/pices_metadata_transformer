    "description": "This journal article references oil contaminant data of invertebrate species: Macoma spp., Modiolus modiolus, Mytilus trossulus, and Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis from Anchor Point, Coal Bay, Coal Point, Diamond Gulch, and Kasitsna Bay, Cook Inlet, Alaska.\n\n  The aforementioned data are referenced in citation: Shaw, D. G. and J. N. Wiggs. 1980. Hydrocarbons in the intertidal environment of Kachemak Bay, Alaska. Mar. Pollut. Bulletin 11(10): 297-300.\n\n  This literature was collected as part of a metadatabase that represents one or more nearshore resources (from physical attributes such as water and air, to birds and mammals).  Each entry is viewable in three formats, 1) a geospatial explicit format (ArcView 3.3) named GIS ArcView 3.3 Near GEM project, 2) a spreadsheet format (Excel 2002 and within ArcView) named GEM Nearshore Metadata Set, and 3) a ProCite database named GEM Nearshore Metadata References, which consists of references included in 1 and 2 above.  The ProCite database record number corresponds to the Excel Procite Number.  Reference Procite #916 for this literature's metadata.\n\n  The metadata are maintained in digital format (ArcView 3.3, Excel 2002, and Procite) and are available from the Alaska Science Center, USGS in Anchorage, Alaska.\n\n  For a detailed description of the three databases and the project, see \"Bodkin, J. L., and T. Dean.  2003.  Alternative Sampling Designs for Nearshore Monitoring (Gulf Ecosystem Monitoring and Research Project G-030687), US Geological Survey, Alaska Science Center, Anchorage, Alaska.\" available on-line at http://www.evostc.state.ak.us/pdf/GEM_final_reports/030687.pdf.",
