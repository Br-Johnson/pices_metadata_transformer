    "description": "The global distributions of the airﾖsea fluxes of heat and freshwater and water\n     mass transformation rates from a control integration of the coupled National\n     Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Climate System Model (CSM) are\n     compared with similar fields from an uncoupled ocean model equilibrium spinup\n     and a new surface Climatology. The Climatology and uncoupled model use the\n     same bulk-flux forcing scheme and are forced with National Centers for\n     Environmental Prediction (formerly the National Meteorological Center)\n     atmospheric reanalysis data and satellite-based cloud cover, solar flux, and\n     precipitation estimates. The climatological fluxes for the open ocean are adjusted\n     to give a global net balance and are in broad general agreement with standard\n     ship-based estimates. An exception is the ice-free Southern Ocean, where the net\n     heat and evaporative fluxes appear to be too weak but where the observational\n     coverage underlying the reanalyze is quite poor. Major differences are observed\n     between the Climatology and the NCAR CSM coupled solution, namely,\n     enhanced tropical and subtropic solar insulation, stronger energy and hydrologic\n     cycles, and excessive high-latitude ice formation/melt producing a several-fold\n     increase in Arctic and Antarctic deep water formation through brine rejection. The\n     anomalous fluxes and corresponding water-mass transformations are closely tied\n     to the coupled ocean model drift, characterized by a reorganization of the vertical\n     salinity distribution. Some error features in the heat flux and sea surface\n     temperature fields are common to both the coupled and uncoupled solutions,\n     primarily in the western boundary currents and the Antarctic circumpolar current,\n     and are thus likely due to the poor representation of the circulation field in the\n     coarse-resolution NCAR ocean model. Other problems particular to the\n     uncoupled spinup are related to the bulk-flux forcing scheme, an example being\n     excess freshwater deposition in the western boundary currents arising from the\n     inclusion of a weak open ocean surface salinity restoring term. The effective\n     thermal restoring coefficient, which relates the change in nonsolar surface heat flux\n     to sea surface temperature changes, is on average 14.6 W m2 K1 for the\n     coupled solution or about a third of the range from the bulk flux forcing scheme,\n     40ﾖ60 W m2 K1.",
