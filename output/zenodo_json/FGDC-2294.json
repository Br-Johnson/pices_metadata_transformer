    "description": "The MS-9 (ocean engineering in frigid environments) of the Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers created and implemented a selected bibliography for use by developers and planners.  It contains abstracts of selected reports and journal articles that cover the range of problems associated with marine systems operating in ice-covered waters.  The emphasis is on marine transportation rather than marine structures.  The location for the source document is given.  There are author/investigator and subject indexes.",
