    "description": "The analytical approach for simulating current groundfish management in the North Pacific U.S. EEZ involves considering interactions among a large number of species (including target, non-target, and prohibited), areas, and gear types.  Modeling was used to predict the likely outcome of management decisions using statistics on historical catch of different species by gear types and areas.  The model outputs biomass of managed fish species.  \n\n\n\n[ Reference: PICES Scientific Report No. 18 2001, Proceedings of the PICES/CoML/IPRC Workshop on \"Impact of Climate Variability on Observation and Prediction of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes in the North Pacific\", http://www.pices.int/publications/scientific_reports/Report18/default.aspx. ]",
