    "description": "Oceanographic surveys have been conducted at 175 stations (22 lines) in the Bering Sea from 1972 to 1981.  Data collected 10 to 12 times a year include fish larvae and eggs, temperature, salinity, DO, phytoplankton, and zooplankton.  Data obtained from the surveys have been published as \"Annual report of oceanographic observations\" and are available through the Korean Oceanographic Data Center (KODC).  \n\n[ Reference: PICES Scientific Report No. 18 2001, Proceedings of the PICES/CoML/IPRC Workshop on \"Impact of Climate Variability on Observation and Prediction of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes in the North Pacific\", http://www.pices.int/publications/scientific_reports/Report18/default.aspx. ]",
