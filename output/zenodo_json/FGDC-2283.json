    "description": "The GLORIA is a long-range, wide-swath sidescan sonar system for use in deep oceanic waters greater than 200 m.  The database consists of about 175 tapes at 1600 bpi containing digital images of the sea floor off the U.S. west coast, Alaska, and Hawaii.  About 55 of the 175 tapes contain raw (unprocessed) images.",
