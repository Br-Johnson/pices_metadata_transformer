    "description": "Parameter\nRiver Flow/Discharge\n\nMeasurement Details\nmonthly and daily stream/river flow\n\nStart of Observations\nvarious (Columbia River data starts in 1878)\n\nCustodian\nUnited States Geological Service\n\nData Distribution\nSummary statistics and monthly values available on the web. Other related information available at http://water.usgs.gov/nwc/contents.html\n\nIOSPBS Data Distribution\nMonthly river flow data files for the Columbia, Fraser, Skeena and Kenai are available at IOS on the SHARE_DATA disk - \\RIVERFLO directory, along with a document that describes the sources of the data.  Historical data from the Fraser River (up to 1990)  were obtained from http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/fraser-river, with recent data added from the USGS website http://water.usgs.gov/nwc/contents.html. Historical data from US from USGS website at http://h2o.usgs.swr . Further details in the RIVERFLO.DOC in the \\RIVERFLO directory\n\nPSARC_Utility\nRiver flow data is key to much work in stock assessment esp. for salmon. River flow/discharge is also an important control over conditions in the Northeast Pacific, where there is very strong influence of fresh water.\n\nImprovements\nAssemble and maintain a single set of river flow data from selected U. S. rivers and make this available in  selected formats.\n\nOther Comments\nCanadian Rivers include Skeena and Fraser\n\nBase Internet/URL ( http://h2o.usgs.gov )  ( http://water.usgs.gov/nwc/NWC/sw/stats/ )\n\n[ A TCODE project ]",
