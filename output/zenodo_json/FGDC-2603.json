    "description": "The objective of this project is to design and program a complete marine ecosystem model for quantitative evaluation of: the effects of man, environmental changes (anomalies) and interspecies interactions on the dynamics of marine ecosystem, with emphasis on economically important species.  The five basic groups of components in this model ;  1) static components,  2) dynamic environmental components and factors,  3) dynamic biological components and factors,  4) effects of man,  5) feedback channels.",
