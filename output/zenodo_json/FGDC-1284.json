    "notes": "Purpose: Each fall, hundreds of polar bears gather along the western shore of Canada's Hudson Bay. They arrive gaunt and straggly, having fasted for months as they waited on land for\n winter to return. Within weeks,  though, the bay will be frozen and the bears will be gone, having ventured far onto the ice in search of ringed seals, their favorite prey.\n\nBut over the last decade, the bay has been freezing later and melting earlier. Polar bear biologist Dr. Ian Stirling, with the Canadian Wildlife Service, says climate warming is making for shorter winters and that means polar bears aren't finding enough seals to eat.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required.\n\nUse constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
