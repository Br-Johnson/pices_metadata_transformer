    "description": "While massive forest fires have so far ravaged more than two million acres across the American West in one of the worst fire season in years, wildfires in Alaska have scorched just over 200,000 acres across the state. Typically, Alaska fires are among the nation's largest, with single burns blackening hundreds of thousands of acres.\nAs Sonya Senkowsky reports in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio, northern forest fires could be a significant source of the greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide.",

    "notes": "Purpose: It's been seven years since lightning triggered the fire that torched a 22,000-acre swath of boreal spruce forest in Interior Alaska, about 90 miles south of Fairbanks. Fire ecologist Eric Kasischke (Kaz/ISS/kee) of the University of Maryland has come to see how the forest is regrowing.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required.\n\nUse constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
