    "description": "Skipjack tuna are fished in the Eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO) by purse seiners (in schools associated with floating objects and in unassociated schools) and by baitboats.  Most of the catches are made between northern Baja California and southern Peru, but the catches are relatively low off southern Mexico.  The fishery extends westward to about 140Â° W in equatorial waters.  Skipjack tagged in the EPO have been recaptured in the central and western Pacific Ocean, but no skipjack tagged in the central or western Pacific Ocean have been recaptured in the EPO.      \n\n[ Reference: PICES Scientific Report No. 18 2001, Proceedings of the PICES/CoML/IPRC Workshop on \"Impact of Climate Variability on Observation and Prediction of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes in the North Pacific\", http://www.pices.int/publications/scientific_reports/Report18/default.aspx. ]",
