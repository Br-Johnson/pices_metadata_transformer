    "description": "While most fishermen are naturally concerned with the bigger critters relatively high on the food chain, the scientific community is busy studying the much smaller, but vastly more abundant species at the other end. What happens there can ripple right up to larger predators, like bankers. The following article details some of the research into the foundations of the food web. Speaking of webs, there are several Web sites cited in the article. For a fast connection dial up the AFJ Website at www.afjournal.com and click on \"Hot Links\" and then on \"Plankton Pics.\"",
