    "description": "SciFish has bathymetry data for all Alaska regions and for many parts of the U.S. West Coast.  The data can be used directly with SciFish software or converted into the file format of user's choosing.  Data sources include: transformed coastline points that agree closely with the best available nautical charts and that have been densified to match the highest resolution of the point data; NODC soundings point data, translated to NAD83 where necessary, and trimmed to agree with the coastline; NODC tracking point data, edited to remove unreliable tracklines, translated to NAD83 where necessary, and trimmed to agree with the coastline; and hand-entered depth soundings from NOAA Nautical charts.  The data will be delivered as a X, Y, Z (lon., lat., depth) ASCII file suitable for ingestion into any database or spatial analysis program on CD-ROM.",
