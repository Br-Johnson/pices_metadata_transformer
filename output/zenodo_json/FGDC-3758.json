    "description": "Using Satellite Image, provided by David T. Sandwell from Scripps Institute of Oceanography, La Jolla, CA 92093, for bathymetric and topological data.  The data are from a satellite image in Mercator Map Projection.  The retrieved data by this program will be in Geographic Coordinates.  Note that it cannot handle the longitude range that cross the Greenwich Meridian.  For detail seafloor bathymetric, use the MultiBeam Database.",
