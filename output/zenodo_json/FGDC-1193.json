    "description": "Studies of hydrothermal plumes on the Juan de Fuca Ridge and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge indicate that newly-formed Fe oxyhydroxides, formed as a consequence of\nhydrothermal venting, readily scavenge P and As from seawater in proportion to the dissolved concentrations of these elements. The Fe content of the suspended\nmatter decreases from 40% near the vents to <5% in ambient seawater, with particulate P and As concentrations correlating well with Fe throughout this range. The\nP/Fe ratio in the oxyhydroxide phase is about 1.8 times higher in Juan de Fuca Ridge samples relative to samples from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. In contrast, the\nAs/Fe ratio in the oxyhydroxide phase is about the same for both regions. Calculated distribution coefficients for P and As in the Fe oxyhydroxide phase show\nremarkable agreement between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Thus, inter-ocean variations in the element/Fe ratios are a function of dissolved concentrations of\nthe chemical species.",
