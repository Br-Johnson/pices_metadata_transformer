    "description": "Data Type: Base Maps  ;Conventional flat nautical charts for navigation are assigned to different scale groups. Harbor Charts are 1:50,000 or larger and are intended navigation and anchorage. Coast Charts are 1:50,000 to 1:150,000 and are intended for coastwise navigation inside the offshore reefs and shoals, entering bays and harbors of considerable size, and navigating certain inland waterways. General Charts are 1:150,000 to 1:600,000 and are intended for use when a vessel's course is well offshore, but when its position can be fixed by landmarks, lights, buoys, and characteristic soundings. Nautical charts are in the process of being put into a raster format but are not yet available.",
