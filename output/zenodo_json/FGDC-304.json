    "description": "Seasonal dynamics of the Kuril Straits, Friz and Bussol, were analyzed on the base of the data obtained in the POI expeditions in 1989-1991 and in the numerical experiments.  The quasigeostrophic barocline model based on the principles of self-similarity of the second order was used.  The numerical experiments have been carried out to calculate the seasonal variability of water circulation and water of the Okhotsk Sea and Pacific Ocean through the Kuril Straits: Friz and Bussol.  The input data for calculations are real fields of the atmospheric pressure (they correspond to the two types of the atmospheric processes predominant for each month), water salinity and temperature turbulent exchange were taken into account.  The fields of wind speed at the sea surface, depth of the homogenous layer, vertical and horizontal components of the current velocity were calculated.  The fields of the stream functions are characterized by some permanent characteristics and specific peculiarities.  The estimation of the values and order of variability of water exchange through the straits according to seasons is presented.",
