    "description": "A new method to estimate seafloor roughness spectra applies the surface backscatter model of Jackson et al. [1986] to multi-beam sonar backscatter data. The use\nof principal components analysis, following spectral estimation, derives a single mappable index from correlated spectral parameters. This index can be mapped as a\ncontinuous field corresponding to geological observations in the area. This method allows for quantitative delineation of the neovolcanic zone and other zones of\nvolcanic and tectonic activity from hull-mounted sonar systems.",
