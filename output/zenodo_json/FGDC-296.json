    "description": "The data consist of estimated number of nursing lines on the teeth of juvenile male northern fur seals from St. Paul Island, Alaska.  Seal cohorts from 1978, 1979, 1981, 1982, 1991 and 1994.  The number of nursing lines represents the number of foraging trips made by the seals' mothers between the seals' birth and weaning.",

    "notes": "Purpose: The dataset was developed in order to compare the number of feeding trips made by lactating fur seals (as an index of prey availability) to the abundance of juvenile walleye Pollock present in the eastern Bering Sea. The null hypothesis was that there was no relationship between the abundance of juvenile Pollock and the number of foraging trips lactating fur seals made.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: None\n\nUse constraints: The data should not be used prior to publication of the manuscript, and should reference the manuscript thereafter.\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
