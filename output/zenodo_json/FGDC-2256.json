The bibliography includes a species index, area index, and a subject index.  In the species index, each entry is followed by letter codes indicating whether the source contains information on abundance, distribution feeding, Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea, Bering Sea, Aleutian Ridge, Gulf of Alaska, or a combination.  There are also a number of references to articles translated from Russian.  The bibliography was published in 1979.",
