    "description": "This book is part of the foreign meteorological data collection held by the NOAA Central Library in Washington, DC.  Information in this collection dates back to the 18th century for daily, monthly, seasonal, and annual tabular summaries, and the 19th century for weather maps.  These data are the result of foreign exchange agreements, but the collection has not been updated since 1983.\n\nIn these summaries, definitions are:\n\n1. Daily/monthly/seasonal/annual data - values determined for each consecutive period, e.g., monthly temperature data: Jan 1900, Feb 1900, etc.\n\n2. Long-term data - values determined over a period of years,  e.g., long-term monthly temperature data using Jan 1900, Jan 1901, etc.\n\nThe data contained in this book are charts of long-term average monthly mean surface air and sea climate parameters for the North Pacific Ocean.  These are for 5 degree squares.  These charts have no contour lines and resemble venn diagrams.  There seems to be no indication of the dates that the data are compiled for. Charts were produced by R.H. Wyman of the U.S. Navy Hydrographic Office.\n\nTables contain the following long-term monthly data:\n         - frequency (number of hours) of rain, fog, and winds (%total)\n         - mean pressure, air and sea surface temperature, and evaporation.",
