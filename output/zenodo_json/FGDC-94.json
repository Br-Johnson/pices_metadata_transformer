    "description": "In this paper, the distributions of nine dominant marine mammal species of the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort Seas region have been subjected to principal components analysis. The six species assemblages that resulted from this analysis imply some degree\nof habitat partitioning. The distribution patterns of these assemblages appear to correlate with sea-ice conditions. For example, a northern Bering Sea assemblage is strongly correlated with broken pack. Also, some areas lack strong association with any\nassemblage, notably Shpanberg Strait, east of St. Lawrence Island. However, the associations identified and presented are hypothetical, and are in need of further testing. Factors other than sea ice must be taken into account in explaining assemblage\ndistributions and interactions between species and the environment. \n\nNOAAServer Codes: [OL 72 55 -130 -168] ; nodateline obtain",
