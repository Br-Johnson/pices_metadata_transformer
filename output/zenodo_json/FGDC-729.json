    "description": "Database: Multi-Resources;   The SEA database includes SEA measurements for Prince William Sound studies, historical archives for biological, oceanographic and weather datasets for PWS. Currents are measured by the SEAOCEAN project using an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP). Advanced Visualization System software is used to allow the user to zoom and navigate interactively through the sound to examine three-dimensional structure of the data. The SEADATA project is using this system to display data collected by multiple SEA groups. Thus allowing distribution of nutrients, plankton, fish and predators to be viewed in relation to one another and to physical conditions such as salinity and current velocity. This system allows users to understand more quickly data from measurements, model simulations and database searches.",
