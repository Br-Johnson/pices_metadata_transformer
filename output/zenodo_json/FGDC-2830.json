    "description": "In the Sea of Japan, Sea of Okhotsk, and Bering Sea, the authors\n     investigated the variability and degree of differences of 12 localities of pink\n     shrimp Pandalus borealis with respect to 11 traits and 10 indices\n     characterizing the body's external morphology. The classification of samples\n     obtained on the basis of Discriminant and factor analysis agrees with the results\n     of population-genetic investigation. The species P. borealis is represented over\n     its range by a small number of local populations, which are equivalent, in the\n     given case, to Mendelian populations as units of panmixis and\n     self-reproduction. The populations' heterogeneity is maintained by ecological\n     and ethnological factors. Local populations have large dimensions, limited, as a\n     rule, by the bounds of individual seas.",
