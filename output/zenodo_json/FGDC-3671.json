    "description": "Subsurface mooring data from the Bering Sea: Station Inner Front 2.  Data were collected from 1994 through 2004.  Sampled months varied through the years but were usually during April and June.  Fluorometer, salinity, temperature, UV vector, and velocity data were collected at various depths throughout the years using instruments such as ADP, MTR, RCM-9, and SEACAT.  55m was the maximum bottom depth.",
