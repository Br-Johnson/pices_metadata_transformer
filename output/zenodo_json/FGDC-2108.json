    "description": "This report references current direction and wave height data of water; diversity, population abundance, and species composition data of invertebrate communities; population abundance and species composition data of scoters (Melanitta spp.); species composition data of invertebrate species: Modiolus modiolus, Mya spp., Macoma spp., Telmessus cheiragonus, and Siliqua spp. from Cook Inlet, Alaska.\n\n  The aforementioned data are referenced in citation: Cunning, A.  1977.  Baseline study of beach drift composition in lower Cook Inlet, Alaska, 1976.  In Environmental Studies of Kachemak Bay and lower Cook Inlet.  Alaska Dept. Fish and Game, Vol. XI, Anchorage, Alaska.\n\n  This literature was collected as part of a metadatabase that represents one or more nearshore resources (from physical attributes such as water and air, to birds and mammals).  Each entry is viewable in three formats, 1) a geospatial explicit format (ArcView 3.3) named GIS ArcView 3.3 Near GEM project, 2) a spreadsheet format (Excel 2002 and within ArcView) named GEM Nearshore Metadata Set, and 3) a ProCite database named GEM Nearshore Metadata References, which consists of references included in 1 and 2 above.  The ProCite database record number corresponds to the Excel Procite Number.  Reference Procite #206 for this literature's metadata.\n\n  The metadata are maintained in digital format (ArcView 3.3, Excel 2002, and Procite) and are available from the Alaska Science Center, USGS in Anchorage, Alaska.\n\n  For a detailed description of the three databases and the project, see \"Bodkin, J. L., and T. Dean.  2003.
