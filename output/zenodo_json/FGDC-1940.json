    "description": "In order to study the impacts of climate change and climate variability on the physical and biological processes in the gyres of the western and eastern subarctic Pacific Ocean, the PICES BASS and MODEL Task Teams examined and developed the ECOPATH/ECOSIM baseline models and linked them to the NEMURO model and tested a number of hypotheses.  This report provides the current understanding of the dynamics of the two subarctic gyres and outlines data availability.\n[ LC Call No. GC781 .P535 no.25.  ISBN 0973149256 ]",
