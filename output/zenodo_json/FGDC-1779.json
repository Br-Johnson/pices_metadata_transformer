    "description": "TNFRI has produced off-Tohoku temperature maps (Tohoku is the district name of the northeastern part of the main island in Japan - Honshu) using temperature data observed in the Mixed Water Region (MWR).  MWR is the Oyashio-Kuroshio inter-frontal zone.  Temperature maps and drawn using hydrographic data collect by Local Fisheries Stations, Meteorological Agency, Maritime Safety Agency, Marine Defense, Fisheries, etc.  See the full list of agencies at http://ss.myg.affrc.go.jp/kaiyo/kaiyoubu/kankei.html.  The Temperature maps of 1984 and 1994 through 2003 are available at http://ss.myg.affrc.go.jp/kaiyo/temp/temp.html.  The target domain is 140-159E and 34-45N.  Historically, 100 m depth isotherms have been drawn monthly by hand since 1944.  Grid data sets with a 5-minute resolution for both longitude and latitude using the flex Gaussian interpolation method have been created.  Also created are temperature maps at 0 m, 50 m, 200 m, 300 m, and 400 m from gridded data.  \n\n[ Reference: PICES Scientific Report No. 18 2001, Proceedings of the PICES/CoML/IPRC Workshop on \"Impact of Climate Variability on Observation and Prediction of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes in the North Pacific\", http://www.pices.int/publications/scientific_reports/Report18/default.aspx. ]",
