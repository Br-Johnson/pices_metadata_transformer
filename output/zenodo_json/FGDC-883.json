    "description": "Data Type: Vegetation/Land Cover/Soils;   The primary theme in this database is vegetation, however many other themes are used in developing the inventory process. Older inventories were aimed at timber resource, however recent and current inventories are integrated and many variables are recorded in inventory databases and will be considered in reports. Preliminary sample phases include land cover classifications developed by DNR for Bristol Bay, Chugach National Forest for some, etc. The inventories included in this database which pertain to the oil spill affected area are: the Kenai Peninsula Inventory, 1987; Prince William Sound/Afognak Island Inventory, 1978; Copper River Inventory, in progress; Southwest and Southeast Alaska Inventory, in progress. Field Inventories in the Tongass National Forest lands began in 1995.",
