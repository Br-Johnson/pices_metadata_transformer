    "description": "The Inner Shelf Transfer And Recycling (ISHTAR) project was a multiyear, interdisciplinary project that sought to understand the processes that support the apparent high production of life in the waters between about 62 ' and 69 ' N in the Bering and Chukchi seas.  All shallower than 100 m and mostly less than 50 m, this region constitutes a portion of the Inner Shelf Domain, shelf zone expected to sustain a low overall annual production characterized by but a single spring pulse of primary production.  Model predictions and the contrasting abundance of upper trophic level biota presented a channeling enigma.",
