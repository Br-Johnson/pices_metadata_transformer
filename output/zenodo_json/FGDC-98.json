    "description": "Salmonid (Oncorhynchus spp.) bycatch data from the 1989 U.S.,\n                        Canada, and Japan monitoring program for Japanese squid driftnet\n                        vessels were analyzed. Sampling effort was consistently less than\n                        expected by proportionate sampling between 170°E and 180°\n                        long., especially during the first part of the month when capture of\n                        salmonids would most likely occur. Salmonid incidence (the\n                        proportion of monitored operations encountering salmonids) was\n                        highest at the western and eastern boundaries of the fishery.\n\n                        Fishing-effort data for the bycatch calculations were divided into\n                        three categories: a portion represented by observer data, an\n                        unrepresented portion that could be estimated by extrapolation of\n                        sampled data, and an unrepresented portion that could not be\n                        estimated. The observers reported a catch of 79 salmonids in 57\n                        monitored operations (4% of total fishing effort). For the estimated\n                        portion (81% of total fishing effort), a bycatch estimator based on\n                        an extension of Aitchison's delta distribution produced a bycatch\n                        estimate of 2,648 salmonids. Although the unestimated portion of\n                        Japanese fishing effort is small, salmonid bycatches there may have\n                        been significant; a Republic of Korea research vessel operating in\n                        an unsampled portion of the fishing area and using 37 tans of\n                        driftnet caught 13 salmonids. This represents over 16% of the total\n                        salmon observed in 1,427,225 tans through the monitoring\n                        program.\n\n                        The problem of unestimated strata may be unique to migratory\n                        species like salmonids which are found only within a small portion\n                        of the total fishing area. In addition, the warm ocean conditions of\n                        1989 probably displaced salmonids northward, restricting the\n                        amount of fishing area intersecting salmonid waters, and inducing\n                        some of the estimation problems associated with our data.",
