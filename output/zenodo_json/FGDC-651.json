    "description": "Data Type: Exxon Valdez Oil Spill;  The Computer Aided Management of Emergency Operations (CAMEO) Valdez (CV89) was designed to track the progress of Exxon's shoreline treatment operations and forecast progress based on recent performance.. It includes four databases: CV89, CV90, CV91 and Segment Summary database. CV90 and CV91 were used to track data during the assessment, treatment, and demobilization phases of cleanup in 1990 and 1991 respectively. the segment Summary database is a compilation of three year's worth of data accumulated from the Exxon Valdez incident with an emphasis on cleanup methods.",
