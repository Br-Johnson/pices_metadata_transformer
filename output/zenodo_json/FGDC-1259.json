    "description": "Mountain climbers spend a great deal of time traversing glaciers, climbing steep, rocky slopes and huddling in snow caves. So it makes sense that they would have noticed the effects of a warmer climate on the world's loftier regions. As Doug Schneider reports in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio, one of the world's top mountain climbers has noticed. He's now helping the rest of us to notice, too.",

    "notes": "Purpose: Unless you read Outside magazine or follow the tight-knit community of mountain climbers, you may not have heard of Conrad Anker.  Still, Anker is a famous guy. He's made numerous first assents, solo assents, and group climbs on many of the most unforgiving peaks in the world. From Alaska to Patagonia to the Himalayas, he's seen firsthand the impact of an ever-warmer planet on the world's glaciers, ice sheets and snow fields.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required.\n\nUse constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
