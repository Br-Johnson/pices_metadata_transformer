    "description": "Scientists for years have used sophisticated satellite images to see how climate warming is changing the Arctic landscape. But as Doug Schneider reports in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio, scientists say aerial photographs taken of Alaska's North Slope during the 1940s offer some of the best evidence of such changesï¾—a dramatic\nincrease in the growth of trees and shrubs in the Arctic.",
