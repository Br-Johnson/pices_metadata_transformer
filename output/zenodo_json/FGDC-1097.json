    "description": "High precision measurements of the solubility of carbon tetrachloride (CCl) in pure water and seawater were made over the temperature range of ~0-40°C. For\ncomparison with previously reported results, the solubilities of CFC-11 and CFC-12 were also measured during these experiments. The experimental data were fit\nto equations in temperature and salinity, in the form used in previous gas solubility studies. The CFC-11 and CFC-12 results were generally in good agreement with\nearlier work, although some differences were noted. For CCl, the standard error of the measurements from the fitted curves was ﾱ2.5%. The concentrations of\ndissolved CCl measured in near-surface waters on a recent long meridional section in the South Pacific Ocean (where the temperature ranged from -1 to 29°C) are\ncompared to calculated saturation levels based on these solubility data and atmospheric levels of CCl measured along the section.",
