    "description": "This digital data set contains selected NOAA 6, 7, 8 and 9 Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) imagery of Alaska; AVHRR is carried on NOAA's polar orbiting satellites.  Spatial referencing is 1.1 km at nadir.  Data source is National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).   The data set includes 47 records with estimated growth rate of 100 records per year.  Storage required varies by storage medium and selected scene.   The file structure is sequential.   Data are available on 9-track, 800 bpi, 1600 bpi, 6250 bpi, unlabeled, unblocked, BCD, fixed record length tape.  Subsets and customs formats are available.  Limited documentation is available.",

Uses include fuel mapping, vegetation monitoring, large area mosaic, and monitoring of ice/snow dynamics.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: Unknown\n\nAccess constraints: None\n\nUse constraints: None\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
