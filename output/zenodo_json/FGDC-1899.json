    "description": "The position and shape of the TZCF in January and February is measured from satellite ocean color data as the boundary between the high surface chlorophyll water of the Transition Zone, and the low surface chlorophyll water of the subtropical gyre.  The boundary is measured as the 0.2mb/cubic ml chlorophyll-a contour line estimated with OCTS data in 1997 and Seawifs data beginning in 1998.  \n\n[ Reference: PICES Scientific Report No. 18 2001, Proceedings of the PICES/CoML/IPRC Workshop on \"Impact of Climate Variability on Observation and Prediction of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes in the North Pacific\", http://www.pices.int/publications/scientific_reports/Report18/default.aspx. ]",
