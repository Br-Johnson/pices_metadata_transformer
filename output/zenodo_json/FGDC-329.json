    "description": "Detailed analysis of the sediment cores from the Bering, Okhotsk Seas and west Subarctic was carried out.  Oxygen and carbon isotope, carbonate and organic contents. Lithology and ice rafted debris, pollen and diatom analyses were used for reconstruction changes in hydrology and productivity, Sedimentology and marine ice cover and surround air and surface water climate respectively. Time scale model was based on oxygen isotope stratigraphy and AMS radiocarbon dating.",
