    "description": "This model investigates the environmental relationship between surface advection during the post-spawning period (pollock egg and larval stages) and pollock survival.  OSCURS surface advection model is used to simulate drift.  The model uses surface advection over a 90-day period to determine the \"goodness\" of the advective field for juvenile pollock.  The model outputs index of pollock recruitment.  \n\n[ Reference: PICES Scientific Report No. 18 2001, Proceedings of the PICES/CoML/IPRC Workshop on \"Impact of Climate Variability on Observation and Prediction of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes in the North Pacific\", http://www.pices.int/publications/scientific_reports/Report18/default.aspx. ]",
