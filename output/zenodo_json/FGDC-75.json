    "description": "Recent climate records from ice cores and deep-sea sediments suggest that\n        there has been considerable climate variability in the North Atlantic region\n        over the past 250,000 years. Much of this variability may be linked to changes\n        in thermohaline circulation in the North Atlantic ocean. Model studies have\n        demonstrated that changes in the flux of fresh water to the ocean, resulting\n        from changes in atmospheric transport or the waxing and waning of ice sheets,\n        can have a significant effect on the thermohaline circulation. The authors\n        present model simulations showing that increased flow of fresher North Pacific\n        water through the Bering Strait into the northern North Atlantic can also\n        effect the thermohaline circulation, by suppressing North Atlantic Deep Water\n        formation; however, decreased flow does not necessarily cause deep-water\n        formation to begin again. In the model, flow through the Bering Strait\n        depends on ecstatic sea level and the salinity difference between the North\n        Atlantic and North Pacific oceans. The authors suggest that a higher sea level\n        during the last interglacial period, leading to greater flow through the Bering\n        Strait, may have made the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation more\n        sensitive than it is at present to fluctuations in the hydrological cycle, which\n        may explain recent observations indicating that climate variability was greater\n        then than it is today.",
