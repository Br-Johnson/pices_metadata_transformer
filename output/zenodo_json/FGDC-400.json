    "description": "In this chapter we describe variation in the distribution of Phytoplankton species associations, total Phytoplankton numbers, biomass and chlorophyll a concentration in oceanic and shelf Phytoplankton communities.  In the oceanic domain, numbers of picophytoplankton dominate during all periods of seasonal succession, followed by nanophytoplankton.",
