    "description": "The paper presents data showing the effect of mesoscale eddies on the\n     distribution of phosphates, nitrates, ammonia nitrogen, organic phosphorus\n     and nitrogen in the Bering Sea. An important role is played by powerful\n     anticyclonic eddies along the edge of the continental slope. Water 'slips' over\n     the slope sometimes down to depths of 600-1000 m and reaches the oxygen\n     minimum layer. Under these conditions renewal of water in the oxygen\n     minimum layer and upwelling of deep water in the adjacent cyclonic eddies\n     take place. The new data call for revision of earlier ideas on the rate of vertical\n     surface, intermediate and deep water exchange.",
