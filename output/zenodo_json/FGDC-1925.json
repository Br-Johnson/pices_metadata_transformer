    "description": "One-day sysmposium reviewed the effects of the 1997/98 El Ni￱o on the physical, chemical and biological state of the northern North Pacific Ocean.  The object was to establish a list of impacts that the climate anomaly had on the ocean, extending all of the way from the physics through the ecoloigcal system, to plankton biology and onwrds to the fisheries.  The symposium organizers wanted to provide a forum for discussion from all regions of interest to the PICES family of nations on the impacts of the El Ni￱o.  The symposium took place in October 1998, when the the Ni￱o was barely over.  All regions reported temperature changes, alterations in the stratification, and reduced nutrients and plankton.  \n\n   [ LC Call No. GC781 .P535 no.10.  ISBN 0968510000 ]",
