    "description": "Atmospheric action center (AAC) are important for general atmospheric circulation.  In Asian Pacific region four AACs are distinguished: North Pacific high, Aleutian low (permanent), winter Asian high and summer Asian low (seasonal).  Mean yearly pressure, longitudinal and latitudinal anomalies of AACs registered in 1947-1994 are studied on the basis of World Hydrometeorological Data Center B.",
