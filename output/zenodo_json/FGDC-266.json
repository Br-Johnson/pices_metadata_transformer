Historical data from the Fraser River (up to 1990)  was obtained from http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/fraser-river, with recent data added from the USGS website http://water.usgs.gov/nwc/contents.html. Further details in the RIVERFLO.DOC in the \\RIVERFLO directory\n\nPSARC_Utility\nRiver flow data is key to much work in stock assessment esp. for salmon.\n\nImprovements\nAssemble and maintain a single set of river flow data and make this available in selected formats.  This may require some negotiation with Environment Canada. Purchase an updated HYDAT CD-ROM and add it to IOS Library collection (can be borrowed).  Data for Canadian rivers from USGS sources should be verified.\n\nOther Comments\n\"This CD-ROM volume is available from: Greenland Engineering Group: 7880 Keele Street, Unit 205\nConcord, Ontario, Canada\nL4K 4G7\nTel.: (905)738-1818\nE-Mail: greenland@grnland.com\"  URL ( http://www.grnland.com/ )  \n[ A TCODE project ]",
