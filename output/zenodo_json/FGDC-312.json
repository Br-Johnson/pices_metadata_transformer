    "description": "The occurrence of 25 algae species known to be harmful has been established in the last 12 years in coastal waters of the seas of Far-Eastern Russia.  A half of them cause water in the seaport zones of vladivostok (Amurskii Bay) and Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky (Avachinskaya Guba Inlet) and also in the zone of Bering Sea shelf near the Korjak Mountain massive.  The cases of water blooms caused by dangerous species were especially numerous in Amurskii Bay in summer and autumn 1987 - 1993.  Red tides caused by dinoflagellates Gymnodinium mikimotoi, Prorocentrum minimum and raphidophytes Heterosigma akashiwo and Chattonella sp., were observed quite often.  Blooms of potentially toxic diatoms Pseudo-nitzshia multiseries, P. pseudodelicatissima and P. pungens were recorded in the beach zone of Vladivostok in June and September 1991 - 1993.  Widespread red tides caused by Alexandrium tamarense accompanied by marine animals mortality were observed in Bering Sea along north eastern coast of Kamchatka in 1988, 1990.",
