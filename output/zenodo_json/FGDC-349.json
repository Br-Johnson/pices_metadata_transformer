    "description": "The impact of mesoscale eddies on Bering Sea hydrochemical structures is shown in distribution of phosphate, nitrate, ammonium, dissolved organic phosphorus and dissolved organic nitrogen.  The specific role of powerful anticyclonic eddies is discussed. Water sinking along the continental slope to 600-1,000 m depths reaches the layer of minimum oxygen concentrations.  Renewal of these layers and upwelling of deep water occurs in adjacent eddies.  Thus, the renewal of deep water takes place considerably faster than was expected.",
