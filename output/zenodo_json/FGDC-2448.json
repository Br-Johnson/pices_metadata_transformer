    "description": "NCDC Monthly Temperature Anomalies (1856-1994)   The data set of Monthly Temperature Anomalies was developed at The  National Climatic Data Center (NCDC). In June 1995, the NOAA Baseline Temperature dataset was merged with a gridded data set of sea surface temperatures to give a truly global anomaly product. The ocean dataset is a compilation of data from the United Kingdom Meteorological Office and the Comprehensive Oceanic and Atmospheric Data Set (COADS). Monthly updates are performed by ERL using the GTS ship reports. This dataset extends from 1856 to 1994.",
