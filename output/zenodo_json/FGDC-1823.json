    "description": "The IPHC has conducted research aboard chartered commercial fishing vessels since 1925.  Since 1925, the IPHC has completed approximately 271 separate charters: 99 using trawl gear and 172 using setline gear.  Charter duration has varied between 1 week to 4 months consisting of 1 to 9 separate trips per charter.  From the regular surveys we obtain data on the sex, size and age composition of the population.  We also collect data on other aspects of biology such as spawning condition, prior hook injuries, and bycatch data on other species.  \n\n[ Reference: PICES Scientific Report No. 18 2001, Proceedings of the PICES/CoML/IPRC Workshop on \"Impact of Climate Variability on Observation and Prediction of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes in the North Pacific\", http://www.pices.int/publications/scientific_reports/Report18/default.aspx. ]",
