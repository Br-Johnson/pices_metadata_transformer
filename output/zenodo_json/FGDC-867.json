    "description": "Data Type: Base Maps;   Topographic quadrangle maps at 1:25,000 scale. Terrain is portrayed by contour lines and features such as roads, towns, water areas, and vegetation are shown by map symbols and colors. Contours are in 5, 10, or 20 meter intervals. Maps were produced from aerial photos taken between 1972-1986. Available as hard-copy paper or mylar maps. It is possible to order a separate, full-scale film negative or positive that shows in black and white all the features printed in a given color on a particular map.",
