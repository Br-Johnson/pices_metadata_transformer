    "description": "This study shows that satellite technology has potential applications to the problem of providing early tsunami warning information in developing nations of the Pacific\nnot having their own regional warning network. A simple conceptual model is developed that shows how these technologies could be integrated into an early warning\n\"system.\" The basic elements are existing instrumentation connected to satellite communication devices for rapid data acquisition and analysis and quick information\ndissemination.",
