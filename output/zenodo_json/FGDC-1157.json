    "description": "Alvin dives and camera tows within the \"meander area\" of the Monterey and Ascension Fan Valleys have located nine chemosynthetic communities over depths\nranging from 3000 to 3600 m over a distance of 55 km. Most of the observed communities consist largely of Calyptogena phaseoliformis, but Solemya (species\nunknown) and a pogonophoran (genus Polybrachia), have also been identified. The  values (-35.0 to -33.6 per mil) and the presence of APS reductase and ATP\nsulfurylase in the C. phaseoliformis tissue is consistent with sulfur chemoautotrophy. Two reduced organic matter sources for the H are proposed: (1) older beds\nexposed by the deep erosion (up to 400 m) of the fan valleys and (2) concentrations of anaerobically decomposed organic matter buried in the valley floor.",
