    "description": "Each spring, bowhead whales return to the Arctic Ocean after a year feeding in the Bering Sea that separates Alaska and Russia. Awaiting them in Alaska are both hunters\nand scientists. As Doug Schneider reports in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio, bowhead numbers are at their highest level in nearly a decade.",

    "notes": "Purpose: The annual hunt for bowhead whales is finally over in the Inupiat Eskimo village of Barrow, on Alaska's north coast. Native hunters harvested 20 bowheads that were each\nprocessed and divided among village residents. North Slope Borough whale biologist Craig George says this year's hunt was a good one, despite the broken ice that choked open leads and fog that made for poor visibility.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required.\n\nUse constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
