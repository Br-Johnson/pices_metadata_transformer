    "description": "Much of the interest in dynamics in the Bering Sea, now and in the past, has been spurred by concerns over the stability and sustainability of its vast living resources.  Particularly prominent today are depressed populations of several species of marine mammals, notably great whales, Steller sea lions, fur seals, harbor seals and sea otters and of additional species of considerable economic importance, such as king crabs, shrimp and Pacific Ocean perch.",
