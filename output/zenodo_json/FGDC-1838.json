    "description": "The bathymetric map of the northern Bering Sea region, plate 1 of USGS Professional Paper 759-B, 1976, was generated using published National Ocean Service maps and an unpublished map from Univ. of Washington. The region covered by the map includes the eastern tip of the Chukotka Peninsula, Russia, east to the Seward Peninsula and northern Yukon Delta, Alaska, and south to St. Lawrence Island, Alaska. The portion digitized was west of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ, or Convention Line of 1867). Only the Russian side of the map was included in the coverage because better data were available for the U.S. side of region from the National Ocean Service, National Geophysical Data Center.",

    "notes": "Purpose: The map was produced with Prof. Paper 759-B to show the diverse topography and complex relief of the sea floor in the Bering Strait and Chirkov Basin areas, and display the relief for future geophysical studies. The Russian side of the map was digitized because bathymetric data for Russia are difficult to find.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: None\n\nUse constraints: None\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
