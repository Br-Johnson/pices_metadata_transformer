    "description": "Last summer, residents of Alaska's Arctic Ocean coast reported seeing migrating salmon, something that no one can remember ever having seen that far north before. But as Doug Schneider reports in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio, scientists say a warmer climate may force salmon to look for colder water far from where they are today.",

    "notes": "Purpose: When Canadian researcher David Welch began studying salmon survival in the North Pacific Ocean, he expected to find salmon throughout the sea. But the further south he went, the warmer the ocean becameï¾—and the fewer salmon he found. As he moved into waters roughly the same latitude as northern California, he didn't find any salmon at all.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required.\n\nUse constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
