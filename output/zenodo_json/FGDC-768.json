    "description": "Data Type: Vegetation/Land Cover/Soils;  The database consists plot information collected in 1993-94 by The Alaska Natural Heritage program under a cooperative agreement with the Chugach National Forest to develop a hierarchical classification of community types, describe the successional plant community sequences, and landcover associations for the Copper River Delta. Plot information was collected by trained field crews and georeferenced to 1:63,360 and 1:60,000 CIR air photos. 286 plots were used to create the classification. These data points reside in a paradox database format. The intended use of these data were used to develop and support the community type classification for the area for use by the U.S.  Forest Service. These data have not been put in a GIS system but are GIS ready.",
