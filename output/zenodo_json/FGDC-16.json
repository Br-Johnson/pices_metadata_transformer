    "description": "Bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) pass near or through offshore oil and\n     gas lease areas in the northeastern Chukchi Sea during their westward\n     migration each autumn. Results of aerial surveys conducted from\n     mid-September through October 1982-1990 indicate that whale distribution\n     overlapped lease area boundaries north and east of Point Barrow, Alaska.\n     Bowhead relative abundance was high throughout the fall in nearshore\n     sub-blocks east, north, and southwest of Point Barrow, with somewhat lower\n     indices in offshore sub-blocks northwest of Point Barrow.",
