    "description": "The global climatology field contains climatological data in the form of monthly entries from points in a 1 X 1 degree resolution latitude/longitude these is the NCAR 20-year climatological temperature. The second, when available, is from another source, usually non-global, when the source is thought for any reason to be more representative of a particular geographic region. Land temperatures will probably not be available initially, but can be added as a 'Day-Two' effort.\n\n  The total file is 242 tracks in length with a physical record being 34 bytes short of a full track long (i.e. 12,996 bytes). Logical records are also 12,996 bytes in length. Temperatures are arranged month-by-month in 12 global grids.\nThe National Climatic Data Center has this data archived on magnetic cartridge.  For archived data contact Thomas Ross at NCDC, telephone 828-271-4499, e-mail: tom.ross@noaa.gov.",
