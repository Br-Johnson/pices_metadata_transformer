    "description": "Rocks dredged from the continental margin in and near the Pribilof and Zhemchug Submarine Canyons indicate that the acoustic basement represents the upper surface of thoroughly lithified marine graywacke and siltstone of late Cretaceous age, and that the gently deformed stratified sequence covering the acoustic basement consists of marine clastic and diatomaceous sediments of late Miocene or possible Pliocene age.  A rich pollen flora in the upper sequence indicates that the shoreline lay only a few kilometers away from the present Pribilof Canyon during the late Miocene or early Pliocene time.",
