    "description": "Neither the enormously high concentrations of silica acid, higher than in any other ocean basin, nor the source, rate of supply and flushing of the deep and bottom waters of the Bering Sea basins have been adequately explained.  In this paper these questions are examined using the few available data and a model describing the silicate distribution is proposed.",
