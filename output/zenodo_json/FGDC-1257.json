    "description": "Northern right whales are among the most endangered species in the world. Just a handful of them perhaps less than a dozen live in the frigid waters off Alaska. So rare are right whales that scientists haven't seen a right whale calf in the North Pacific Ocean in nearly 150 years. So it came as a surprise when scientists exploring the\nocean floor in 1999 encountered the skeleton of a right whale. Doug Schneider has more in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio.",

    "notes": "Purpose: The discovery was made by scientists aboard the Alvin submersible during an exploratory cruise of the Patton Seamount, an undersea volcano near Kodiak, Alaska. A videotape of the discovery now resides in the hands of Brad Stevens, a biologist with the National Marine Fisheries Service in Kodiak. As the video plays on a television monitor, Stevens describes the nearly intact skeleton of a 40-foot whale.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required.\n\nUse constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
