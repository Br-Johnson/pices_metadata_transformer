    "description": "With animals like sea lions and sea otters in trouble, and salmon returns declining, marine scientists met recently in Anchorage to assess the health of Alaska's oceans. Alaska's seas are still cleaner than most, but just like other places, the oceans that nearly surround the state have their share of problems. As Doug Schneider reports in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio, one scientist says research on the ocean's smallest fish is needed to understand the big changes happening in the marine environment.",

    "notes": "Purpose: It often seems that there's no shortage of research being done in Alaska waters. We often hear about studies on whales, seals and other marine mammals. And studies of commercially important fish like halibut and salmon are also common.\n\nBut despite a wealth of data, researchers who gathered at a recent Anchorage conference on Alaska's oceans and watersheds said they don't know the intricate details of just how the ocean food chain works and what factors influence it. Doug DeMaster is director of the Alaska Fisheries Science Center. He says more needs to be learned about this and large-scale ecosystem changes triggered by events like climate warming and El Niï¿±o, for example.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: None\n\nUse constraints: None\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
