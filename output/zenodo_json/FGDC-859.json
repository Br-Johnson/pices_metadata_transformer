    "description": "Data Type: Remotely Sensed Data;   The French Earth Observation Satellite, SPOT, produces digital satellite imagery with the highest spatial resolution that is commercially available. Panchromatic (black and white) imagery has a resolution of 10x10 meters, and is commonly used for detailed mapping, feature identification, change detection, and updating of vector files. Multispectral imagery (visible and infrared) has a resolution of 20x20 meters and is used for land use and land cover mapping and natural resource studies. SPOT Image offers its digital ortho-imagery in standard 7.5, 15, and 30 minute map frames.",
