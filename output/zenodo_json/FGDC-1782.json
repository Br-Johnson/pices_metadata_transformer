    "description": "Oceanographic surveys have been conducted at 175 stations (22 lines) in the Korean waters (Sea of Japan and East China Sea) since 1961.  Data collected 6 times a year include temperature, salinity, DO, zooplankton, nutrients (from 1995), Chl-a (from 1995 in the South Sea of Korea).  Data obtained from the surveys have been published as \"Annual report of oceanographic observations\" and are available through the Korean Oceanographic Data Center (KODC).  \n\n[ Reference: PICES Scientific Report No. 18 2001, Proceedings of the PICES/CoML/IPRC Workshop on \"Impact of Climate Variability on Observation and Prediction of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes in the North Pacific\", http://www.pices.int/publications/scientific_reports/Report18/default.aspx. ]",
