    "description": "The data base contains Nimbus 7 SMMR radiances and sea ice parameters gridded onto the SSM/I polar stereographic projections on alternate days from October 1978 to August 1987.  Radiances are from 8 of the 10 SMMR channels at both horizontal and vertical polarizations: 6.6, 10.7, 18.0, and 37.0 ghz.  Sea ice parameters include total and multiyear sea ice concentrations.",
