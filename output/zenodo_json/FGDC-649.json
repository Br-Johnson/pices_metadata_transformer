    "description": "Data Type: Exxon Valdez Oil Spill;  Raw bathymetric data was received from National Ocean Services (NOS). The data is in a fifteen second grid format with an average sea depth recorded for each cell. Areas of missing or scattered data were covered by manual entry of over 12,000 points from published NOS charts (scale 1:80,000). Contour intervals were generated from this data and the State coastline by using Delauney Bivariate interpolation methon (ARC/INFO rev. 5.0.1 TIN), and reflect mean lower low water. This dataset was compiled to provide bathymetry information for the oil spill damage assessment and restoration efforts.",
