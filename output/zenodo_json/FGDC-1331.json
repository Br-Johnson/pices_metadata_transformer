    "description": "Monthly means of MEDS (Canadaﾒs Marine Environmental Data Service) subsurface temperature observations which are received from NOAAﾒs National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) (http://www.nodc.noaa.gov) by PFEL are available for download from PFELﾒs Live Access Server (LAS) (Live Access Server http://www.pfeg.noaa.gov/products/las.html). The temperature data have been averaged on a 1 degree latitude/longitude grid and interpolated to 19 standard depth levels. The interpolation procedure to produce isotherm depth is a simple linear interpolation which begins at the surface.\n\nThese data are Best Copy data. NODC receives higher resolution delayed-mode data which often duplicates or supercedes real-time profiles. The Best Copy data provide the most complete dataset, however the real-time data is updated more frequently.\n\n\n[ Reference: PICES Scientific Report No. 18 2001, Proceedings of the PICES/CoML/IPRC Workshop on \"Impact of Climate Variability on Observation and Prediction of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes in the North Pacific\", http://www.pices.int/publications/scientific_reports/Report18/default.aspx. ]",
