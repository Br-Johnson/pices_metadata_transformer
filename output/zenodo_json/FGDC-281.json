The observation starting years are different along to the stations. Recently, there are some stations in which the observation were stopped by the change over the self-operating lighthouse.\n\nGeographic Area\nKorean coastal waters\n\n\n\nBase Internet/URL ( http://www.nfrda.re.kr/kodc/data/data_e.html )  ( http://www.nfrda.re.kr/kodc/data/codata/index.html )\n\n[ A TCODE project ]",
