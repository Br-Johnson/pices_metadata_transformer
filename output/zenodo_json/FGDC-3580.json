    "description": "This project is a program at the University of Alaska that fosters the implementation and operation of ocean-observing systems in the Northern Gulf of Alaska.  The SALMON Project, in cooperation with other institutes, is providing continuous real-time or near real-time observations of ocean circulation and ecosystems and linking these with models to provide ocean forecasts in much the same way that weather forecasts are made.\n\n  Provided information includes: mesoscale survey, SeaWiFS images, Coastal Gulf of Alaska (CGOA) numerical modeling, real-time sea surface temperatures, CODAR (real-time mapping of surface currents) in Alaska, the Gulf of Alaska 4 (GAK4) mooring, and bathymetric maps.",

    "notes": "Purpose: To bring together managers, industry partners, researchers, educators and others in a collaborative efforts to establish an ocean observatory in the Northern Gulf of Alaska, from Kayak Island in the east to the Shumagin Islands west of Kodiak, including Price William Sound and Cook Inlet and the outer coast of Kodiak.  These observations and forecasts will enhance and protect the livelihoods of those who use this productive water body and depend on its ecosystem for food, livelihood, recreation, and transportation.\n\nStatus: In Progress\n\nMaintenance frequency: Unknown\n\nAccess constraints: None\n\nUse constraints: Check with Source.\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
