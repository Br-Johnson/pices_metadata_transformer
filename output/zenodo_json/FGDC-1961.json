    "description": "Few animals are as difficult to study as the Pacific walrus. They're big, for one thing. And they sometimes don't take well to anesthetizing drugs. As Sonya Senkowsky reports in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio, researchers in Alaska hope to make their jobs easier by combining modern technology with an ancient hunting tool.",

    "notes": "Purpose: The Pacific walrus is a massive animal, about the size and weight of a compact car. Before working up close with these two-tusked Titans, researchers need to dart them with drugs that temporarily put the animals to sleep.\n\nBut there's a problem. These mighty giants are wimps when it comes to drugs. They can be felled by just a few drops of anesthetic. And sometimes they can't be revived.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: None\n\nUse constraints: None\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
