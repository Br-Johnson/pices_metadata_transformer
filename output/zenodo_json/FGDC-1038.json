    "description": "Dimethylsulfide (DMS) concentrations have been measured in over 1000 Pacific surface seawater samples during the past 4 years. The data have been tabulated to take into account both regional and seasonal variations in concentration. The area-weighted summer and winter concentrations of DMS in the North Pacific Ocean are 2.2 and 1.3 nmol/L, respectively. Wind speed, surface seawater temperature, and DMS diffusivities are used to calculate air-sea exchange coefficients. The area-weighted summer and winter DMS piston velocities are 2.3 and 2.7 m/d, respectively. These exchange coefficients combined with the concentration data yield a net ocean to atmosphere DMS flux in the North Pacific Ocean of 0.12 Tmol/yr. Extrapolating this calculation by regional areas to the global ocean yields a net DMS flux of 0.50 Tmol/yr, less than earlier estimates of 1.2 Tmol/yr, but still consistent with excess sulfate deposition estimates and model studies of the marine atmospheric sulfur budget. The uncertainty in the flux estimate is roughly a factor of 2.",
