    "description": "4 transect lines off Oregon and northern California are sampled three times per year as part of the U.S. GOBEC program, in April, July and September.  The time series began in July 1997 and will continue through 2003.  Transect lines include Newport OR (44째40N), Coos Bay OR (43째13'N), Rogue River ORE (42째30'N) and Crescent City CA (41째54'N).  The transect lines extend beyond the continental shelf to 160 km from shore (2900 m water depth) off Newport; Coos Bay to 63 km from shore (1700 m); Rogue River to 64 km from shore (3060 m depth); and Crescent City to 150 km from shore (3400 m depth).  At each station CTD casts are made.  At most stations nutrients and chlorophyll are sampled from 9 discrete depths, and zooplankton is sampled with the vertical tow net from 100m to the surface.  Bongo tows were made at most stations in 1998 and 1999.  Beginning in March 2000, zooplankton were collected from discrete depths using a 1 sq. m MOCNESS system.  WOCE drifters are released at five stations along the Newport Line (10. 15. 25. 45 and 65 miles from shore).  On each cruise underway measurements are made of currents (ADCP), and fish and zooplankton acoustics using an HTI 244 system.  In addition to the coast-wide sampling, the Newport Line is sampled in February and November, giving us five visits per year to the deep ocean along that line.   \n\n[ Reference: PICES Scientific Report No. 18 2001, Proceedings of the PICES/CoML/IPRC Workshop on \"Impact of Climate Variability on Observation and Prediction of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes in the North Pacific\", http://www.pices.int/publications/scientific_reports/Report18/default.aspx. ]",
