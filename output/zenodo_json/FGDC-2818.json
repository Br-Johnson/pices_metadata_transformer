    "description": "Spatial distribution, biomass, feeding habits, and size composition of catches\n     of the smooth lumpsucker Aptocyclus ventricosus (Pallas) are investigated on\n     the basis of four trawl surveys in the pelagic zone of the western and central\n     parts of Bering Sea in 1986-1989 and material stored in archives derived\n     from 32 expeditions in 1976-1989. There are always markedly high\n     concentrations of fish in the northern part of the Aleutian Basin. During\n     foraging excursions, the species is encountered in deep-sea waters from the\n     surface to depths of more than 500 m, most often in the 100-200 m layer.\n     Their minimal length on reaching sexual maturity is 20 cm. Spawning migration\n     to the coastal region starts in November-December. In the eastern part of the\n     sea, spawning extends from December through April and through June in the\n     western part. The young remain at the coast until they reach 2-3 cm. A basic\n     scheme of migration showing the known spawning regions is presented.",
