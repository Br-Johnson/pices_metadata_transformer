    "description": "Relatively little is known about distribution patterns and species associations of forage fishes in the Bering Sea despite their importance as major prey of many higher trophic level organisms, such as seabirds, marine mammals and predatory fishes.  In this study, we examined survey data on some dominant pelagic forage fishes (Pacific herring Clupea pallasi, capelin Mallotus villosus and eulachon Thaleichthyes pacificus).",
