    "description": "The JODC-Expert Grid data for Geographic - 500m) J-EGG500 are bathymetric data and have been circulated as 500m meshed data on Lambert's conformal conic projection.  The data set includes three areas: (1) latitude: N 34 to 46 (degrees), longitude : E 135 to 148 (degrees)  (2) latitude: N 30 to 38 (degrees), longitude : E 128 to 144 (degrees)  and (3) latitude: N 24 to 30 (degrees), longitude : E 122 to 132 (degrees).",
