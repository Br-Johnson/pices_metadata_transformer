    "description": "Data Type: Fish  ; This historical database records the numbers of fish stocked in any location around the state supplementing the sport and commercial fisheries. Data covers 1966 to the present although the older data tends to be less reliable. Information is included for all species which FRED stocks and is limited to only those stockings by hatcheries owned by the state. This database ties into the Coded Wire Tag Database of the ADF&G Commercial Management and Development Division.",
