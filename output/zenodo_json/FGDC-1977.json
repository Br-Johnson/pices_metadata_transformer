    "description": "In the ongoing debate over what's causing the decline of Alaska's Steller sea lions, researchers have studied everything from nutritional stress to climate change. Now researchers have turned their attention to killer whales. As Doug Schneider reports in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio, scientists say the chance to see if killer whales are eating too many sea lions is also a chance to learn more about killer whales themselves.",

    "notes": "Purpose: Researchers spent last summer combing the coastline of western Alaska, looking for signs that killer whales are feasting on the region's Steller sea lions. While they did observe orcas attacking sea lions, researchers say killer whales probably aren't the main cause of the sea lion's overall population decline. Still, researchers say at least some killer whales seem to prefer the taste of fresh sea lion meat.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: None\n\nUse constraints: None\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
