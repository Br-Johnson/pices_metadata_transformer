    "description": "Consists of six-hourly and daily upwelling indices at 15 positions along the west coast of North America at each 3 degrees of latitude from 21°N to 60°N and are derived from synoptic (six-hourly) sea level pressure gridded fields by PFEL.  \n\nThe coastal upwelling index is an index of the strength of the wind forcing on the ocean which has been used in many studies of the effects of ocean variability on the reproductive and recruitment success of many fish and invertebrate species.\n\nSource data are US Navy Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography (FNMOC) synoptic surface pressure analyses.  Primary products are derived from the FNMOC 360x181 global spherical one degree surface (mean sea level) atmospheric pressure fields nominally available at six-hourly intervals. Historical segments of products are derived from FNMOC 63x63 northern hemisphere polar stereographic or from the FNMOC 73x144 global spherical pressure fields with same nominal availability.\n\nDownload the latest and archived coastal upwelling indices by using the Live Access Server to subset, plot time series, and more at http://las.pfeg.noaa.gov/las/main.pl or by downloading traditional files at http://www.pfeg.noaa.gov/products/PFEL/modeled/indices/upwelling/NA/data_download.html.\n\n[ Reference: PICES Scientific Report No. 18 2001, Proceedings of the PICES/CoML/IPRC Workshop on \"Impact of Climate Variability on Observation and Prediction of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes in the North Pacific\", http://www.pices.int/publications/scientific_reports/Report18/default.aspx. ]",
