    "description": "This model was designed to determine the minimum state variables needed to represent a generic Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton (NPZ) marine ecosystem model for the North Pacific.  Ecosystem fluxes are tracked in units of both nitrogen and silicon.  Carbon flux process equations have been added recently.  \n\n[ Reference: PICES Scientific Report No. 18 2001, Proceedings of the PICES/CoML/IPRC Workshop on \"Impact of Climate Variability on Observation and Prediction of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes in the North Pacific\", http://www.pices.int/publications/scientific_reports/Report18/default.aspx. ]",
