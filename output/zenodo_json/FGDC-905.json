    "notes": "Purpose: Zooplankton and top predator communities are known to quickly respond to climate variability and change. This project is designed to examine seasonal, interannual, and possibly interdecadal variability in North Pacific Ocean and southern Bering Sea marine\necosystems. This research will provide information on predator-prey associations (e.g., aggregative response) in water masses of varying characteristics. Information will be used by ocean government agencies and others for fisheries and wildlife management and conservation.\n\nStatus: In Progress\n\nMaintenance frequency: Continually\n\nAccess constraints: Permission of Contributor required\n\nUse constraints: Permission of Contributor required\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
