    "description": "Oregon, Washington, and Alaska (defined in this report as the\n                        Pacific Northwest) exports of edible fishery products in 1993\n                        declined 4.7% in quantity from 1992 to 1.49 billion pounds (lb) or\n                        676,272 metric tons (t). The value of these fishery exports\n                        declined by 16.2% to $2.15 billion. Although there were declines\n                        in exports of Groundfish, salmon, crab, and herring, the decrease in\n                        total exports was primarily due to the 25% decline in Groundfish\n                        exports and the 10.5% decline in salmon exports. In 1993,\n                        Groundfish exports of $833 million and salmon exports of $798\n                        million accounted for 38.7 and 37%, respectively, of the total\n                        value of Pacific Northwest fishery exports. The value of Pacific\n                        Northwest exports comprised 72.7% of total U.S. edible fishery\n                        exports, down from 76.6% in 1992. In 1993, Pacific Northwest\n                        exports were shipped to 37 countries with the top 4 countries\n                        accounting for 94% of the total. Except for increased trade with\n                        Canada and the People's Republic of China, trade of fishery\n                        products declined with the major importing countries (Japan,\n                        Republic of Korea, the United Kingdom, France, and Australia).\n                        Exports to Japan totaled $1.7 billion or 79.7% of the total, down\n                        16.7% in value from $2.06 billion in 1992. Canada jumped to the\n                        second spot with shipments increasing by nearly 50% to $142\n                        million or 6.6% of total exports. The Republic of Korea slipped to\n                        the third spot with $98 million or 4.6% of the total exports, down\n                        22.8% from $127 million in 1992. Pacific Northwest exports to\n                        the United Kingdom dropped 38.5% from 1992 to $77 million or\n                        3.6% of the total exports.",
