    "notes": "Purpose: Of all the exotic places to go scuba diving, places like the Caribbean, Tahiti or Hawaii perhaps come first to mind. Odds are, Alaska's Arctic Ocean coast won't even be on your list. That's not surprising, since much of the state's northern coast consists of, well, featureless, almost lifeless, mud. Not exactly the sort of place you're likely to find a Club Med. On a good day, the ocean here might be a bone-chilling 30 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nBut let's not discount the place altogether. Twenty-five years ago, geologists looking for oil in Stefansson Sound came across a jumble of rocks and boulders and cobbles. Ken Dunton, a marine scientist at the University of Texas at Austin, was among the first people to lay eyes on what is now called the Boulder Patch.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: None\n\nUse constraints: None\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
