    "description": "This graphics sector file contains one image of graphics for Sitka in the Gulf of Alaska. This file has no header record. Each logical record in this graphics file corresponds to an image row and each word in a logical record corresponds to an image column: the pixels are one byte in length. The number of data records is the same as the number of image rows and the length of the records is the same as the number of columns. Each of the eight bits in a pixel represents an individual graphics plane. The graphics file is used as input by IMGMAP, which overlays the image it produces with the graphics present in the graphics file. This graphics file can be downloaded to any display work station to display graphics.",
