    "description": "The U.S. Air Force Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) system of 2 near-polar orbiting satellites provides information in visible (0.4 - 1.1 micrometers) and infrared (10.4 - 12.5 micrometers) formats.  Data are archived after operational use.  Frequent global coverage (up to 4 times daily) is useful for observing changes in snow and ice boundaries on regional to global scales, as well as for a wide variety of meteorological\nand cloud studies.  The DMSP is the only meteorological satellite to operate visible-band sensors at night.",
