    "description": "This file contains time series measurements of ocean currents. These data are obtained from current meter moorings and represent Eulerian method of current measurement, i.e., the meters are deployed at a fixed depth and measure flow past a sensor.  Position, bottom depth, sensor depth, and meter characteristics are reported for each station.  On-line documentation is available on the NOSIE system location on the NODC VAX computer and published in the NODC User's Guide.",
