The AVHRR satellite imagery is collected by NOAA and is available in positive transparency format for 1974 to the present.  Several passes a day covering the Beaufort, Chukchi and Bering Seas as well as mainland Alaska and the Gulf of Alaska are received in visual and infrared format. Also available are facsimile paper prints from 1982 to present.",
