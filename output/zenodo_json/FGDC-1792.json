    "description": "Juvenile salmonids are sampled along 5-8 transects off the Washington and Oregon coasts in May, June and September.  This work began in 1998 and will continue for approximately five more years.  Pelagic fish are sampled with a Nordic 264 rope trawl (30 m wide by 20 m high by 200 m long) fitted with a 0.8 cm cod end liner.  At each trawl station, zooplankton is sampled with a 0.5 m diameter 202 µm mesh net towed vertically from 100 m to the surface, with a 1-m^2 mouth neuston (manta) net (333 µm mesh net) and with a 1-m diameter 333 µm mesh net from 20 m to the surface.   \n\n[ Reference: PICES Scientific Report No. 18 2001, Proceedings of the PICES/CoML/IPRC Workshop on \"Impact of Climate Variability on Observation and Prediction of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes in the North Pacific\", http://www.pices.int/publications/scientific_reports/Report18/default.aspx. ]",
