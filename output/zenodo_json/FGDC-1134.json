    "description": "The objective of the NOAAServer project is to develop a framework that will provide a unified view of NOAA's environmental information databases to the Web\nuser. To accomplish these goals NOAAServer provides a Web-based interface that allows the user to search, preview, and download NOAA's data holdings. This\npaper focuses on the problem of data distribution from NOAA data servers to clients. This problem is complicated by the nature of NOAA's data holdings: the\ndatasets are geographically distributed and in a wide range of formats. Our solution is to use a four-tier distributed object approach, using the Common Object\nRequest Broker Architecture (CORBA). The four tiers include a client, the mirror site Web server, a local data server, and legacy applications. The client provides a\nuser interface that allows the user to select and display subsets of NOAA's data library. The client communicates with the Web server using the hypertext transfer\nprotocol (HTTP). The mirror site Web server and local data server communicate via the CORBA Internet Inter-Orb Protocol (IIOP), which supports distributed\nobjects. These objects provide a consistent model for issuing data requests and representing the data. The local data server's responsibilities include passing requests\nfor data to the legacy application, retrieving data from the legacy application, and translating this data representation to the distributed object data model. The legacy\napplication will access the local data files or database and return the results of data requests to the local data server. The four-tier design using a distributed object\ndata model to unify the components ensures that the user sees a unified view of NOAA's environmental databases.",
