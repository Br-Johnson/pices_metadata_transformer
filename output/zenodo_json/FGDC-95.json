    "description": "The need for developing a bioenergetics model for walleye Pollock\nin the eastern Bering Sea has been previously established. The\n\"Fish Bioenergetics Model 2\" of Hewett and Johnson was adapted\n to walleye Pollock. Appropriate submodels for consumption,\nrespiration, egestion, and excretion were selected and\nparameterized. Seasonal aspects of growth, reproduction, caloric\ndensity, and diet composition of walleye Pollock are described, as\n well as the seasonal water temperature and the caloric density of\nwalleye Pollock prey. The synthesis of published and unpublished\ndata required for parameter estimates and seasonal descriptions is\ndocumented and discussed for each aspect of the bioenergetics\nmodel.",
