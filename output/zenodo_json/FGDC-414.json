    "description": "Bering Sea Fisheries-Oceanography Coordinated Investigations (BS FOCI) was a coastal fisheries ecosystems project of NOAA's Coastal Ocean Program (Boyles and Scavia 1993, Wenzel and Scavia 1993) from 1991 through 1997.  BS FOCI was established to seek understanding of the factors that control abundance of fish populations, with a specific goal of reducing uncertainty in resource management decisions through ecological research on walleye Pollock and stock structure in the Bering Sea.  Using a competitive process, BS FOCI awarded research components to academic scientists from several universities and to scientists from NOAA's Alaska Fisheries Science Center and Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory.  BS FOCI developed collaborations with Russian, Korean and Japanese scientists.  The National research Council (1994) reviewed accomplishments and plans of  BS FOCI.",
