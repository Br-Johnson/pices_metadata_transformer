    "description": "The Stellar Watch system is a time-lapse photography system for remote Steller sea lion sites.  The remote image data collection system was devised to observe Stellar sea lions and determine predation of other mammals, juvenile and pop survival rates, and population counts.  The system uses time lapse photography from remote solar powered cameras to gather data.",
