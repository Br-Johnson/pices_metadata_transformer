    "description": "A time series sediment trap experiment was conducted at 3,200 m in the Bering Sea Basin (53 30'N, 177.00'W; 3,788 m) during 1991 and 1992 to determine seasonal variation in the processes of biological production in the surface water of the Bering Sea. The seasonal pattern of downward  fluxes of organic matter in the Bering Sea was characterized by three high peaks in flux (May, July-August and October) each with different sinking properties.",
