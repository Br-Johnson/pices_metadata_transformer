    "description": "This scientific report summarizes the results of workshops organized by the PICES-GLOBEC Climate Change and Carrying Capacity Program held just prior to the Eighth Annual Meeting in Vladivostok, Russia, in October 1999. In addition, a very successful modelling workshop was subsequently convened in Nemuro, Japan, the following January.  \n\nThe MONITOR Task Team meeting was much devoted to an extensive review and discussion of international efforts in GOOS (Global Ocean Observing System), which will serve as a framework for questions about how to get oceanographic data into a useable form in a timely manner. The data from these new initiatives will form the basis for the monitoring systems of the future.  \n\nThe REX Task Team held a workshop to review the population dynamics of herring and euphausiids around the Pacific Rim. Typical of small pelagic animals, large changes in the abundance of these key members of coastal ecosystems are observed over time, and interesting data on the changes in feeding success and overwinter energy depletion were reported. An interesting development within the North Pacific are the reports on longer-term fluctuations in herring abundance, which will no doubt serve to provide a better perspective on the short-term fluctuations evident when only data from modern fisheries is examined. A number of interesting relationships were also noted between the abundance of herring and euphausiids from around the Pacific Rim.\n\nthe MODEL Task Team met to discuss developments during the past year and to make the final plans for an intensive workshop scheduled for Nemuro, Japan, in January 2000. The extensive report from that meeting is included here, and describes the results of a substantial effort by many members of the PICES modelling community to develop a consensus on the essential elements of an ecosystem model for the North Pacific Ocean; their progress in doing so will provide an essential stepping stone towards a better understanding of what aspects of the ecosystem are most important to measure and monitor in the future.\n\n   [ LC Call No. GC781 .P535 no.15. ]",
