    "description": "Measurement Details\nmeasurement of sea level (and lake level) heights from various stations in Canada\n\nGeographic Area\nCanada; Northeast  Pacific\n\nIOSPBS Data Distribution\nData for BC coastal stations (monthly averages) are available at IOS. (CCS$PHYSICS:[LIGHTHOUSE.ARCHIVE.MONTHLY]). Howard Freeland maintains time series from three stations (BAMFIELD, TOFINO and PRINCE RUPERT).  These data need careful appraisal due to tectonic effects and instrumentation problems.\n\nPSARC_Utility\nvariations in sea level height have been used as evidence of El Nino conditions and other oceanographic anomalies.\n\nImprovements\nGenerally in good shape. Some additional file format options might be useful (IOS HEADER format, spreadsheet/CSV format).\n\nBase Internet/URL\nhttp://www.meds.dfo.ca\n\nA TCODE project",
