    "description": "Coastal ecosystems (bays, inlets, lagoons and estuaries) are the first barrier on the pathway of the different chemical contaminants arising due to human activities at the neighbor lands and coastal waters.  The high value of the biological and recreational resources of coastal ecosystems demands assessment of the possible damage from the chemical contamination.  The traditional manner for such investigations is based on the measurement of the contaminants concentration in the different ecosystem components (water, suspended matter, bottom sediments, organisms) and evaluation of the harmful effects of these concentrations by the toxicological tests.",
