    "description": "Data Type: Recreations;  This layer contains data on anchorages in the Prince William Sound and Copper River Delta region. The data was collected during a conference on \"Critical Forest Habitats in the Greater Prince William Sound\" in Cordova, Alaska in November 1992, sponsored by the Prince William Sound Science Center and the U.S. Forest Service Copper River Delta Institute. The data is based on areas mapped during the conference by recognized experts and users, and includes judgments on the aesthetic quality of the anchorages.",
