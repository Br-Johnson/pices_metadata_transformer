    "description": "Harvest logs supplied by commercial invertebrate fishers.\n\nMeasurement Details\nRecords for commercial fishing vessels, date, location, gear, and amount of catch for various species, as well as an indication of effort required to make that catch. Separate databases maintained for each species.\n\nCanadian Pacific Coast\n\nOther Comments\nThe data collection process provides many opportunities for error and misinterpretation.  Although the data sets have been cleaned up *enormously* in the past year, they should not be thought of as 100% accurate.  Accuracy is improved as time and new information permits. Currently the data resides in a set of independent MS ACCESS databases for each fishery or species.  Eventually they will all be consolidated into a single ORACLE database.\n\nA TCODE project",
