    "description": "This journal article references oil contaminant and population abundance of black oystercatchers (Haematopus bachmani), harlequin ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus), and nearshore bird communities from Naked Island, Prince William Sound, Alaska.\n\n  The aforementioned data are referenced in citation: Murphy, S.M., R.H. Day, J.A. Wiens, and K.R. Parker.  1997.  Effects of the Exxon Valdez oil spill on birds: Comparisons of pre- and post-spill surveys in Prince William Sound, Alaska.   Condor 99:299-313.\n\n  This literature was collected as part of a metadatabase that represents one or more nearshore resources (from physical attributes such as water and air, to birds and mammals).  Each entry is viewable in three formats, 1) a geospatial explicit format (ArcView 3.3) named GIS ArcView 3.3 Near GEM project, 2) a spreadsheet format (Excel 2002 and within ArcView) named GEM Nearshore Metadata Set, and 3) a ProCite database named GEM Nearshore Metadata References, which consists of references included in 1 and 2 above.  The ProCite database record number corresponds to the Excel Procite Number.  Reference Procite #699 for this literature's metadata.\n\n  The metadata are maintained in digital format (ArcView 3.3, Excel 2002, and Procite) and are available from the Alaska Science Center, USGS in Anchorage, Alaska.\n\n  For a detailed description of the three databases and the project, see \"Bodkin, J. L., and T. Dean.  2003.
