    "description": "Data from merchant ships travelling between British Columbia and Japan, from 1980-1990 (Canada Ace), 1995 to 2000, continuing (Skaugran), and 1999-2000, continuing (Alligator Hope). Data collected include surface total carbon dioxide, alkalinity, nutrients, chlorophyll a, carbon-13 in seawater, and atmospheric carbon-13. Underway measurements include position, time, temperature and salinity. Skaugran samples and data were collected 3-4 times daily by scientific staff and once daily by ship`s engineers until 1999, then were reduced to daily engineer`s samples. Alligator Hope samples were collected 3 times daily.",

Salinometer calibrated with standard seawater. Fluorometer calibrated with commercially prepared standard. Data are plotted to detect outlyers.\nData quality - Completeness: Dataset Complications: Some CTD data from the Alligator Hope are questionable. Chlorophyll data may be questionable. Canada Ace data are of unknown quality, and therefore will not be released. No data collected 1991-1994. For some programs, fewer parameters were measured.\nElectronic Data Complications: Magnetic tapes are older than their guaranteed physical lifespan.\nLineage - Process steps:\n  1.
