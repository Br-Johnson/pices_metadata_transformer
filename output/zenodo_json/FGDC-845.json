    "description": "Data Type: Infrastructure;  The Community Profile Database has been designed to serve as a principal reference source for recent, reliable, summary information about the subsistence uses within the economies of rural Alaskan communities. The database also provides summary information on the commercial-wage sector of a community's economy, recognizing that subsistence uses are part of a mixed subsistence-cash economy in rural Alaska communities. In addition, the database contains information on community demography and community geographic location relative to fish and game management areas, census areas and federal conservation land units. The Community Profile database exists in two forms: (1) a printed database catalog in 6 volumes, and (2) a computerized database system, housed at regional offices of the Division of Subsistence.",
