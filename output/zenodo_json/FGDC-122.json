    "description": "The Institute of Marine Science (IMS) maintains an oceanographic database using the Ingres (tm) relational database management system (RDBMS). It contains physical, chemical, biological and geological data from the Gulf of Alaska, Bering Sea, Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea, Prince William Sound, Cook Inlet and other coastal waters. Currently,\nthe database contains data as far back as 1970 and it is about 500 Mbytes in size.  Access is restricted to IMS researchers. However most data can be extracted from the database and forward to other researchers on a at-cost basis. Copies of most data were submitted to the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC).\n\nPhysical Oceanography\n% STD - Salinity, Temperature and Depth. 60% of the database.\n% CM - Current Meters.\n% TG - Tide Gauges.\n\nBiological Oceanography\n% INFAUNA - Benthic Data from the Bering and Chukchi Seas.\n% PHYTO - Phytoplankton data from the ISHTAR project.\n% ZOOP - Zooplankton data from the ISHTAR, APPRISE and other projects.\n% CHL - Chlorophyll data from the ISHTAR project.\n% PP - Primary productivity, carbon and nitrogen uptake data from the ISHTAR\nproject.\n\nChemical Oceanography\n% NUTRIENT - Nutrient chemistry data from the ISHTAR project.\n% METAL - Heavy metal concentration data. (very small)\n\nGeological Oceanography\n% GRAIN SIZE - Sediment grain size data from the Beaufort and Chukchi seas.\n\nExxon Oil Spill Data\n--------------------\nThis database is \"litigation sensitive.\" Access is restricted to researchers\nworking on the Coastal Habitat Injury Assessment (CHIA) project.\n% INTERTIDAL\n% Invertebrates\n% Fishes\n% Algae\n% Semicircle Density\n% Limpet Growth/Survivorship\n% Mussel Growth/Survivorship\n% Swath Data\n% Mussel Histology\n% Photo Analysis\n% SUBTIDAL\n% Shallow Infaunal and Epifaunal Data\n% Deep Infaunal Data, 40+ Meters\n\nThe Institute of Marine Science (IMS) is the oldest and the largest\nunit of the School of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences. It is active in\nresearch and graduate training at the masters and doctoral levels,\nsupports coastal facilities at Seward and Kasitsna Bay, and operates\nthe 133-foot research vessel Alpha Helix for the National Science\nFoundation.",
