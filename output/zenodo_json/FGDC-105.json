    "description": "The Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) of the United States\n                        and the Pacific Research Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography\n                        (TINRO) of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (U.S.S.R.)\n                        conducted a cooperative bottom trawl survey of the Bering Sea\n                        aboard the Russian research vessel Novokotovsk during\n                        May-July 1990. The primary purpose of this survey was to assess\n                        the distribution, abundance, and biological condition of Groundfish\n                        resources in both the eastern and western Bering Sea continental\n                        shelf. A separate and completely independent trawl survey of the\n                        central and southeastern Bering Sea continental shelf was also\n                        conducted by the AFSC during this period aboard two U.S.\n                        research vessels.\n\n                        Results summarizing geographic distribution, abundance estimates,\n                        and size composition are presented for the principal species of fish\n                        encountered. The distribution and relative abundance of the\n                        commercially important crab species are also shown. Results of\n                        the cooperative survey are compared to the results of the separate\n                        1990 U.S. survey from the areas commonly fished in the eastern\n                        Bering Sea. The appendices include station and catch information,\n                        detailed abundance, size, and age data.",
