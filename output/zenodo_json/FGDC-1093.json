    "description": "Measurements of the chlorofluorocarbons CClF (F-11) and CClF (F-12) made in the subsurface anoxic zones of the Black Sea and Saanich Inlet, B.C., Canada\nshow a pronounced depletion of dissolved F-11. These zones are strongly reducing and are characterized by the absence of dissolved nitrate (NO) and the\npresence of hydrogen sulfide (HS). Models incorporating the atmospheric input histories of these CFCs and the observed distributions are used to estimate\nresidence times for water in these zones and first order in-situ removal rates for F-11. In contrast, measurements in the mid-depth low-oxygen zone of the eastern\nPacific (where NO is present and HS is below detection limits) do not show evidence of similar rapid F-11 removal.",
