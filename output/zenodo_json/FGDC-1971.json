    "description": "Each year dead seals, walrus, sea lions and even whales wash onto Alaska's beaches. Such finds are a treasure trove to scientists, but scientists can't be everywhere marine mammals wash ashore. As Doug Schneider reports in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio, Alaska Natives are trained to collect valuable information from marine animals that wash onto the state's far-flung beaches.",

    "notes": "Purpose: To a scientist, the chance to study whales, seals and walrus alive in their natural habitat offers a unique glimpse into a rarely seen world. But there's only so much a scientist can learn from watching and following live marine mammals in the wild. For some things, you need to have a specimenï¾—that is, a dead animal that you can examine and dissect. \n\nMost of the time this is simply not possible because federal law protects marine mammals. Yet scientists say lots of marine mammals die from any number of causes, and sometimes they wash ashore. These strandings offer researchers the chance to learn a great deal.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: None\n\nUse constraints: None\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
