    "description": "Statistical analysis of 1950-1953 data on the biomass of mesoplankton shows\n     biomass variations over the range 770 Mg/m super(3) in summer to 74 mg/m\n     super(3) in winter with an annual average of 240 mg/m super(3). These values\n     are in good agreement with seasonal variations observed at ocean weather\n     station \"P\" in the Northeast Pacific (50 degree N, 145 degree W) over the\n     period of 1954-1964.",
