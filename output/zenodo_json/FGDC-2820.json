    "description": "Oikopleura vanhoeffeni Lohmann were collected from the northern Bering Sea shelf in the summers of 1983 and 1986. This is the first record of the occurrence of the species in this area. Distinct morphological structures differentiate the species from those previously reported. The adult specimens having a heart-shaped left stomach lobe from the Bering Sea were smaller than those having a circular one from the North Atlantic. O. vanhoeffeni was abundantly distributed in the area of the northeast to east of St. Lawrence Island with a maximum density of 762 individuals per m super(-3). Whereas, the species was completely absent in the waters north of the island. Geographically, the distribution of O. vanhoeffeni was clearly restricted to the Bering Shelf Water.",
