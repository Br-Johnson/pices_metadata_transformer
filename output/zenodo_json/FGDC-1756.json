    "description": "An interactive version of the Smith & Sandwell (1997) global ocean bathymetry map, the most complete, high-resolution image of sea floor topography currently available. The map was constructed by blending depth soundings collected from ships with detailed gravity anomaly information obtained from the Geosat and ERS-1 satellite altimetry missions. This combination of data yields a globally uniform level of resolution ideal for displaying major tectonic features, such as mid-ocean spreading ridges or fracture zones.  \n\n[Reference: Smith, Walter H.F., and David T.
