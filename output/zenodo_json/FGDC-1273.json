    "description": "While many scientists link the causes of climate change to humans burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas, other scientists say thereﾒs not enough evidence to blame people. As Doug Schneider reports in this weekﾒs Arctic Science Journeys Radio, one scientist says the climate may be responding more to natural cycles and that the climate may actually have begun to cool.",
