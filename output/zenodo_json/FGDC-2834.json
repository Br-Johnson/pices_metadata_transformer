    "description": "Populations and productivity of seabirds were monitored at two colonies in\n     the Bering Sea, Cape Peirce and Bluff, and at Cape Thompson, in the\n     Chukchi Sea. Murres and kittiwakes were monitored at all three colonies to\n     facilitate intercolony comparisons. These species were selected because they\n     are relatively easy to study, numerous, sensitive to potential impacts of\n     development, and widely distributed. Monitoring methods were standardized\n     among the three colonies to facilitate comparisons among colonies and year.\n     Populations and productivity were monitored in a portion of each colony, on\n     permanent plots that were delineated on photographs and viewed from the top\n     of the cliff. Observations of productivity began at the time nests were\n     established and continued until most young had fledged. Kittiwake nests and\n     murre breeding sites used for estimation of productivity were mapped on\n     photographs or sketches and the fate of each was recorded.",
