    "description": "Recent seismic observations and new crustal thermal models suggest that near-axis (ﾱ1 km from the spreading axis) hydrothermal cooling increases linearly with increasing spreading rate. We present here the first corroborating evidence from near-axis hydrothermal plume observations. Comprehensive surveys of plume distributions have now been conducted on multi-segment portions of ridge crest with full-spreading rates from 20 to 150 km/Myr. These surveys find that ph, the fraction of ridge crest length overlain by hydrothermal plumes, and full-spreading rate, us, are related by ph = us, where  = 0.004 Myr/km. We recast this large-scale spatial variability into long-term temporal variability by postulating that any vent-field site is hydrothermally active an us fraction of geologic time. We then use this relationship and the mean of eight studies that have determined instantaneous heat flux, Ha, at vent-field scales, 75 ﾱ 45 MW/km, to estimate the time-averaged heat flux, , as Haus. Applying these scaled values of  to the distribution of mid-ocean ridge spreading rates yields a global near-axis heat flux, , of 8.8 ￗ 1011 W. This value is ~10% of the total oceanic hydrothermal heat flux, and agrees with a crustal cooling model-derived value of  of 9 ￗ 1011 W. Our estimate of  implies a mean global 3He/heat ratio of 2.4-8.3 ￗ 10-13 cm3/J (STP), and a high-temperature hydrothermal fluid flow of 1.8 ￗ 1013 kg/yr.",
