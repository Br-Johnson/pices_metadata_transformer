    "description": "The texture of surficial sediments, defined as the size-frequency distribution of unconsolidated grains, is an important attribute of the coastal ocean environment.  In addition to purely geological applications, data of this type have great utility in habitat studies seeking to explain the distribution and abundance of important biological resources.
