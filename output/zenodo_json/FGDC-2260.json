    "notes": "Purpose: This computerized, interactive atlas represents a compendium of Arctic marine information (through 1986) from a variety of sources.  As an electronic \"publication\" it is easily updated.  This results in a dynamic document that is conveniently located on a researcher's or manager's desk.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: Unknown\n\nAccess constraints: Contact Source.\n\nUse constraints: None\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
