    "description": "I examined the distribution, species composition, and foraging ecology of seabirds in the western Bering Sea over the past two decades.  There is large variability in estimates of number of nesting seabirds in the western Bering Sea, because of differences in assessment methods.  Over 4.1 million individuals were estimated to nest in the western Bering Sea in the 1960s to 1980s but more recent, precise methods provide an estimates of nearly 11 million individuals.",
