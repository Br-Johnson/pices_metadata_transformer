    "description": "A review of research on tides in the Bering Sea and presents new results obtained from numerical models.  The focus of investigations is a description of the enhanced tidal currents.  Dynamics of the tidal currents are shown to be closely related to the tidal period.  In both semidiurnal and diurnal bands of oscillations the tides travel from North Pacific through the deep basin onto the shelf.\n\nAn NPMR project",
