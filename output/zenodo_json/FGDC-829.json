    "description": "Data Type: Elevation  ; Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data consist of an array of regularly spaced elevations. DEM data in 15-minute units consist of regular arrays of elevations arranged horizontally to the coordinate system of NAD 27. The spacing between elevation along profiles is 2 arc seconds of latitude by 3 arc seconds of longitude. Each profile has 451 elevations. DEM data for 15-minute units correspond to the USGS 15-minute topographic quadrangle map series in Alaska. The unit sizes in Alaska vary depending on the latitude. Unit south of 59 degrees North cover 15x20-minute areas, those between 59 and 62 degrees North cover 15x22.5-minute areas.",
