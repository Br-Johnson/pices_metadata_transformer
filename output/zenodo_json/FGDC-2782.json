    "description": "Oceanographic, meteorological and sea-ice data were obtained from the northern Bering Sea and Chukchi Sea during the autumns of 1987 and 1988. Ice-edge location was observed from ships and via AVHRR satellite data, and ice-drift information was obtained from ARGOS- tracked drift buoys. Meteorological data were obtained from ships, from an ARGOS-tracked meteorological station and from synoptic charts. The ice edge was significantly farther south in 1988 than during other years and impacted the Alaskan coastline. In 1987, the ice edge was, conversely, anomalously far north. Ice melt-back in certain regions, such as along the Alaskan coast and in Herald Canyon, was due to input from warm ocean currents. The larger- scale interannual differences in ice extent were, however, due to interannual differences in the regional winds. In particular, the anomalous and extreme southward extent of the ice edge during 1988 was due to northerly to northwesterly winds, which held the summer pack ice against the beach. Meltwater form this ice salt- stratified the upper water column, so that the ice eventually became effectively insulated against vertical flux of heat from the underlying warm water in the coastal current.",
