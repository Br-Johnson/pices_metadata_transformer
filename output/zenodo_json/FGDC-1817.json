    "description": "An ECOPATH model of Prince William Sound was constructed by a collaboration of experts from the region during 1998-1999 (Okey and Pauly 1999).  The Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council (EVOS) funded this effort for the purpose of \"ecosystem synthesis\".  The project was coordinated by the UBC Fisheries Centre and overseen by NMFS Office of Oil Spill Damage Assessment and Restoration.  Prince William Sound is well defined geographically; spatial definition of the system consisted of drawing lines across Hinchenbrook Entrance, Montague Strait and smaller entrances.  The time period represented by the model is 1994-1996, as this is the post-spill period with the broadest and most complete set of ecosystem information.  This food web model consists of 48 functional groups ranging from single ontogenetic stages of special interest species to highly aggregated groupings.  A variety of hypotheses are being address with the PWS model - most related to the 1989 EVOS and the fisheries in the area.    \n\n[ Reference: Okey, T. A., and Pauly, D. 1999.
