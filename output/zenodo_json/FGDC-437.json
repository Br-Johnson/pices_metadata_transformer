    "description": "During June 1999, we will conduct a line transect survey of marine mammals in conjunction with NOAA/AFSC/MACE cruise dedicated to hydroacoustic assessments of pollock in the Bering Sea.  A mesoscale synoptic and will cross the shelf from outer Bristol Bay to west of the Pribilof Islands, extending as far as the Inner Front (50 misobath) on the shelf.  A single towed hydrophone (200 Hz to 22khz and 30 kHz to 150 kHz) with collect acoustic data.
