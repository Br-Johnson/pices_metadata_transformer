    "description": "This review focuses on modeling ocean circulation and its variability in the subarctic North Pacific; it addresses issues specific to that region, and not the subject of ocean modeling in general.  The performance of existing models is assessed in relation to observations in the upper ocean, intermediate waters and deep/abyssal waters.  \n\n[ LC Call No. GC781 .P535 no.5.  ISBN 0969842058 ]",
