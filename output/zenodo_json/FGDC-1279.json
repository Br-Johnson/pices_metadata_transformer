    "description": "In 1997, at the height of an El Ni￱o summer, a massive plankton bloom turned the sea off Alaska the color of milk, and killed hundreds of thousands of seabirds. Now, scientists say that bloom may have triggered profound changes in the ocean food web. Doug Schneider has more, in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio.",

    "notes": "Purpose: Looking out from the wheelhouse of the research vessel Alpha Helix, things on Alaska's Bering Sea appear normal. Dall's porpoises dart across the front of the ship, while gray whales breach in the distance. As puffins their bellies bulging with food take flight from the ship's path, Dr. Terry Whitledge recalls the conditions that led to the massive plankton bloom seen here three years ago.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required.\n\nUse constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
