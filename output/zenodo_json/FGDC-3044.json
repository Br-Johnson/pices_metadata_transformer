    "description": "This report references biomass data of invertebrate communities; population abundance and species composition data of black oystercatchers (Haematopus bachmani), harlequin ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus), scoters (Melanitta spp.), invertebrate species: Littorina sitkana, Littorina spp., Mytilus trossulus, and nearshore bird communities, and invertebrate communities; species composition data of algal species: Fucus distichus, Laminaria groenlandica, and Zostera marina and fish species (Anoplarchus purpurescans); population abundance data of sea otters (Enhydra lutris); and shoreline geomorphological type data of sediment from Port Valdez, Prince William Sound, Alaska.\n\n  The aforementioned data are referenced in citation: McRoy, C. P. and S. Stoker.  1969.  A survey of the littoral regions of  Port Valdez.  In Baseline data survey for Valdez Pipeline Terminal. Environmental Data Survey (D.W. Hood, ed.), Report R6-17, Inst. Mar. Sci., Univ. Alaska, Fairbanks. pp.190-235.\n\n  This literature was collected as part of a metadatabase that represents one or more nearshore resources (from physical attributes such as water and air, to birds and mammals).  Each entry is viewable in three formats, 1) a geospatial explicit format (ArcView 3.3) named GIS ArcView 3.3 Near GEM project, 2) a spreadsheet format (Excel 2002 and within ArcView) named GEM Nearshore Metadata Set, and 3) a ProCite database named GEM Nearshore Metadata References, which consists of references included in 1 and 2 above.  The ProCite database record number corresponds to the Excel Procite Number.  Reference Procite #645 for this literature's metadata.\n\n  The metadata are maintained in digital format (ArcView 3.3, Excel 2002, and Procite) and are available from the Alaska Science Center, USGS in Anchorage, Alaska.\n\n  For a detailed description of the three databases and the project, see \"Bodkin, J. L., and T. Dean.  2003.  Alternative Sampling Designs for Nearshore Monitoring (Gulf Ecosystem Monitoring and Research Project G-030687), US Geological Survey, Alaska Science Center, Anchorage, Alaska.\" available on-line at http://www.evostc.state.ak.us/pdf/GEM_final_reports/030687.pdf.",
