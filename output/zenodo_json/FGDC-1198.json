    "description": "In 1990 and 1991, particles from buoyant and neutrally buoyant hydrothermal plumes above hydrothermal vents at the North Cleft segment of the Juan de Fuca\nRidge were sampled to study their changing composition and fluxes away from the vent field. In the rising buoyant plume, >75% of the P, V, Cr, and As scavenging\nfrom seawater by hydrothermal precipitates occurs in the first 50 m above the vent. Cu and Zn are most enriched in buoyant plume particles collected from the first\nfew meters above the vent. However, the degree of enrichment decreases very rapidly with increased height above the vents due to sedimentation of the more dense\nCu- and Zn-rich sulfide phases. Using the plume data, coupled with the results of our analysis of sediment trap samples, we estimated that more than 99% and\n99.9%, respectively, of the total hydrothermal Fe and Mn produced at the vent field are transported beyond the vent field and dispersed in the open ocean.",
