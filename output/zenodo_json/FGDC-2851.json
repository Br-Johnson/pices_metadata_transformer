    "description": "This book references population abundance and species richness data of invertebrate communities, oil contaminant data of invertebrate species (Mytilus trossulus), and oil contaminant and shoreline geomorphological type data of sediment from the Gulf of Alaska.\n\n  The aforementioned data are referenced in citation: Gilfillian, E.S., T.H. Suchanek, P.D. Boehm, E.J. Harner, D.S. Page, and N.A. Sloan.  1995.  Shoreline impacts in the Gulf of Alaska region following the Exxon Valdez oil spill.  In Wells, P.G.; Butler, J.N.; Hughes, J.S. (eds.). Exxon Valdez Oil Spill: Fate and Effects in Alaskan Waters. American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) 1219, Philadelphia, PA, 1995. pp. 444-547.\n\n  This literature was collected as part of a metadatabase that represents one or more nearshore resources (from physical attributes such as water and air, to birds and mammals).  Each entry is viewable in three formats, 1) a geospatial explicit format (ArcView 3.3) named GIS ArcView 3.3 Near GEM project, 2) a spreadsheet format (Excel 2002 and within ArcView) named GEM Nearshore Metadata Set, and 3) a ProCite database named GEM Nearshore Metadata References, which consists of references included in 1 and 2 above.  The ProCite database record number corresponds to the Excel Procite Number.  Reference Procite #385 for this literature's metadata.\n\n  The metadata are maintained in digital format (ArcView 3.3, Excel 2002, and Procite) and are available from the Alaska Science Center, USGS in Anchorage, Alaska.\n\n  For a detailed description of the three databases and the project, see \"Bodkin, J. L., and T. Dean.  2003.
