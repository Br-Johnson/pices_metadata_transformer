    "description": "Surface Phytoplankton with their physiochemical environments were sampled in the international zone of the Bering Sea and in the Bogoslof Island region during summer (July) 1994 and 1995.  Surface chl a concentrations ranged from 0.54 to 10.2mug(-1) during the study period.  Areas with the higher chl a values (3.4-10.2mugl(-1)) were located in the continental shelf break and in the Bogoslof Island region.  Waters in the Bogoslof were characterized by a dominance of microplanktonic (>20mu) diatoms such as Corethron criphilum, Chaetoceros spp., Rhizosolenia spp.  The highest chl a value was measured at Station 6 in the Bogoslof with 10.2mugl (-1) which was about 15 to 20 times higher value compared to that in the international zone of the Bering Sea.  It is speculated that such a high Phytoplankton biomass in the Bogoslof region was caused by water column stability which was developed near the continental shelf break.  Less saline waters (32.2-32.5%) in the northeastern part for the Bering Sea seem to be intruded to the open waters and created a front to cause increase of Phytoplankton biomass.  Surface temperature ranged from 5.3 to 8.7 (average 7.2 ± 0.6 C) in 1994 and from 9.8 to 12.4 C (average 10.7 ± 0.8 C) in 1995, respectively. Surface temperatures showed weak influence on Phytoplankton distribution, but about 3 C surface temperature difference between 1994 and 1995 may affect on the phytoplankton growth.  Mean values of major nutrients such as nitrate, phosphate and silicate were 6.2 ±3.2 mu, 0.87 ±0.4mu, 14.5 ±7.0mu in 1994, respectively.  With increase of Phytoplankton decrease of the major nutrients was observed.",
