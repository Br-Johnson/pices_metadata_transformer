    "description": "The causal links between magmatic/tectonic processes and hydrothermal venting along the mid-ocean ridge axis will be difficult to discern\nwithout broadband observations of the temporal variability of hydrothermal activity. I report here on temporal variability in the intensity\nand distribution of chronic and event plumes generated by continuous and episodic hydrothermal discharge at two vent fields on the Cleft\nsegment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge. Hydrothermal temperature () and light attenuation (c) anomalies were comprehensively mapped\nbetween 1 and 4 times per year during nine cruises from 1986 to 1991. Intensity of  and c in the chronic plume overlying the north\nCleft vent field showed more variability between years than within a given year. Both  and c were exceptionally high in 1986, fell to\nmoderate levels during 1988 to 1990, and declined to minimum values in 1991. The chronic plume over the south Cleft vent field varied\nsimilarly. Superimposed on the chronic plumes were brief and intense releases of hydrothermal fluid that created event plumes\ndistinguishable by their symmetry and exceptional rise height. Event plumes at the north Cleft field ranged from the 1986 megaplume, with\na rise height exceeding 1000 m, to smaller events in 1987 and 1989 with rise heights of ~400 m. Chronic hydrothermal heat (660 ﾱ 277\n(1) MW) and mass (204 ﾱ 86 (1) g s) fluxes from the north Cleft field were determined by assuming these fluxes were equivalent to\nthe long-term net advection of a mean cross-section of the vertically integrated  and c in the plume. This 6-year history of hydrothermal\nplumes indicates that episodic discharge has been an important component of the recent hydrothermal flux and that the aggregate heat and\nmass fluxes declined significantly, though not consistently, between 1986 and 1991.",
