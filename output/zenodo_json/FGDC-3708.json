    "description": "Subsurface mooring data from Chiniak Bay, Gulf of Alaska: Station Chiniak Bay 2.  Data were collected from 1994 through 2004.  Sampled months varied through the years but were usually during May.  Salinity, temperature, and UV vector data were collected at various depths throughout the years using instruments such as MicroCAT and RCM-9.  120m was the maximum bottom depth.",
