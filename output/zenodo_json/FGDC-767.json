Various surveys are intended to provide information relevant to development for urban use, rangeland, cropland or farming; selection of road, pond, or building sites; or value of the land as wildlife habitat. Tabular data in the reports includes soil characteristics (pH, depth, etc.), suitability and limitations of soil types, and flood hazard information. This tabular data is also available in database format.",
