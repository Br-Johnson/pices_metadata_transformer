    "description": "Sediment trap, surface, and subsurface mooring data from Bering Sea, Bering Sea: Station Bering Sea 3.  Data were collected from 1994 through 2004.  Sampled months varied through the years but were usually during February, March, April, and September.  Air temperature, barometric pressure, salinity, shortwave radiation, temperature, UV vector, velocity, vector, and wind speed data were collected at various depths throughout the years using instruments such as ADCP, PAR, MTR, Neil Brown, RCM-4, RCM-7, SEACAT, and WeatherPAK.  127m was the maximum bottom depth.",
