    "description": "Operational satellite data are available from the northwestern Pacific, Japan, Okhotsk and western Bering Sea from the Far Eastern Regional Receiving Center in Khabarovsk (FERRC), which holds historical data from Russian Meteor Kosmos, Ocean and Resurs and NOAA satellites services since the 1970s, and receives operational information.  The Inter-Institute Center for Satellite Monitoring of the Environment in Vladivostok maintains time-series from NOAA AVHRR from January 1999.  \n\n\n[ Reference: PICES Scientific Report No. 18 2001, Proceedings of the PICES/CoML/IPRC Workshop on \"Impact of Climate Variability on Observation and Prediction of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes in the North Pacific\", http://www.pices.int/publications/scientific_reports/Report18/default.aspx. ]",
