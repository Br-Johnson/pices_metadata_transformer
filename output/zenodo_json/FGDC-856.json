    "description": "Data Type: Remotely Sensed Data;  Alaska AVHRR Data Set is comprised of twice-monthly maximum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) composites created from daily NOAA-11 satellite observations. The goal of the Alaska AVHRR project is to compile a comprehensive time series data set of calibrated, georegistered daily observations and twice monthly maximum NDVI composites for each annual growing season. This data set has applications for environmental monitoring and assessing impacts of global climate change. The NDVI composites include ten bands of information: AVHRR channels 1-5, maximum NDVI, satellite zenith, solar zenith, and relative azimuth. The daily observations, bands 1-9, have been calibrated to reflectance, scaled to byte data, and geometrically registered to the Albers Equal-Area Conic map projection. The tenth band is a pointer to identify the date and scene ID of the source daily observation (scene) for each pixel. All image processing was conducted using the Land Analysis System (LAS) software. Often when displaying data covering large areas, such as AVHRR data, it is beneficial to include an overlay of familiar linework as a location aid, or a mask to derive statistical data for regions. All of the line work images represent lines in raster format as 1 km cells and the strata are represented as polygons registered to the AVHRR data. The line work and raster polygon data sets include are the international boundaries, Alaskan roads and Trans-Alaska Pipeline, and a raster polygon mask of the State borders. The EROS Data Center standard product is a set of multiple CD-ROM.",
