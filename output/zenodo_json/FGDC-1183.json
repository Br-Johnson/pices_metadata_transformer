    "description": "In order to study the effects of sewage effluents on the flocculation of trace elements in a stratified estuary, water samples were collected from the Duwamish River\nEstuary at stations located above and below the Renton Sewage Disposal Site. The water samples were filtered through 0.2-µm pore size Nuclepore filters, the\nfiltrate mixed with various amounts of filtered sea water from Elliott Bay, and the products refiltered onto 0.2-µm filters and analyzed for major and minor elements\nby x-ray secondary emission spectrometry. The results show that the downstream samples produced two to three times more flocculated material and three to five\ntimes more P, Ca, Fe, Ni, Cu and Zn than the upstream samples. In contrast, little differences were found for Al and Ti. Similar experiments utilizing the effluent from\nthe Renton Sewage Treatment Plant also showed the same trends, suggesting that the sewage effluent enhanced the flocculation of these elements in the estuary.\nMajor element analysis of the flocculated material indicates that it is mainly composed of organic material.",
