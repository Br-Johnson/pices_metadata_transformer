    "description": "Two major Zooplankton species of copepod and euphausiids in the southeastern Bering Sea were analyzed for Pu contents in order to assess that anthropogenic radionuclide pollution.  Pu concentration in Thysanoessaa sp. and Neocalanus cristatus are 0.04 ±0.01 and 0.12± 0.05 Bq/kg dry wt., respectively.  Pu contents in the major Zooplankton species in the Bering Sea fall within the reported values in the Northeast Pacific Ocean.",
