    "description": "Sea ice concentration data set was derived from the dual-polarized 37-ghz channel radiances from the Nimbus-7 SMMR.  Sea ice concentrations, i.e., fraction of ice cover in a 30 x 30 km field of view, are grouped in scenes, each covering an area of 780 x 780 km.  This data set was derived from the cell-all tapes (NSSDC id 78-098a-08b), and there are six days of data per one or two tapes.  These tapes are available from NSSDC A similar data set (map-30) containing six-day and monthly averages of 37-ghz horizontal polarization channel brightness temperatures projected on to 533 x 533 mercator map grids is also available from NSSDC.  The map-30 data set was also generated from the cell-all tapes.  No map-30 data were produced beyond year 5 (October 1983).",

Sea ice concentrations, i.e., fraction of ice cover in a 30 x 30 km field of view, are grouped in scenes, each covering an area of 780 x 780 km.\n\nStatus: In Progress\n\nMaintenance frequency: Unknown\n\nAccess constraints: None\n\nUse constraints: None\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
