    "description": "Measurement Details\nThis data set is produced by taking the MOHSST5 version of the GOSTA data set from the U.K. MET office as the input SST data set to various processing steps. These steps include EOF projection, Optimal Interpolation (OI), Kalman Filter (KF) forecast, KF analysis, and an Optimal Smoother (OS). Thus these techniques fill in any missing data using both spatial patterns derived from the data that exists together with time interpolation. The data set is stored on a 5x5 grid and consists of monthly mean anomalies from 1856-1991. Anomalies are based on the 1951-1980 time period. Here is a complete description of the data set from the originators (http://ingrid.ldgo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.KAPLAN/.RSA_MOHSST5.html).\n\nOther Comments\n\"Original Source: Alexey Kaplan, Yochanan Kushnir, Mark A.
