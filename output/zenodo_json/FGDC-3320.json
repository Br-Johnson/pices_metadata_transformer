    "description": "This report references population abundance and species composition data of goldeneyes (Bucephala islandica), harlequin ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus), scoters (Melanitta spp.), and nearshore bird communities and population abundance data of sea otters (Enhydra lutris) from Kenai Peninsula, Cook Inlet, Alaska.\n\n  The aforementioned data are referenced in citation: Nishimoto, M. and B. Rice.  1987.  A re-survey of seabirds and marine mammals along the south coast of the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska during the summer of 1986.  U.S. Fish and Wildl. Serv., Alaska Maritime Natl. Wildl. Refuge, Homer, Alaska.\n\n  This literature was collected as part of a metadatabase that represents one or more nearshore resources (from physical attributes such as water and air, to birds and mammals).  Each entry is viewable in three formats, 1) a geospatial explicit format (ArcView 3.3) named GIS ArcView 3.3 Near GEM project, 2) a spreadsheet format (Excel 2002 and within ArcView) named GEM Nearshore Metadata Set, and 3) a ProCite database named GEM Nearshore Metadata References, which consists of references included in 1 and 2 above.  The ProCite database record number corresponds to the Excel Procite Number.  Reference Procite #719 for this literature's metadata.\n\n  The metadata are maintained in digital format (ArcView 3.3, Excel 2002, and Procite) and are available from the Alaska Science Center, USGS in Anchorage, Alaska.\n\n  For a detailed description of the three databases and the project, see \"Bodkin, J. L., and T. Dean.  2003.
