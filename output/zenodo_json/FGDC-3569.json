    "description": "This archive tape contains copies of the Target Matchup Data Base (NSS.PSATAVST.SST.TARMCH) and the SST Matchup Data Base (NSS.PSATAVST.SST.MCHUP). It is produced on the 3rd of each month, archiving data for the previous month. The Target Matchup Data Base contains raw data targets (i.e. AVHRR and HIRS/2 raw data, calibration coefficients, and earth location information) as well as any retrieved SST's for selected geographic positions. If a target position coincides with a fixed buoy location, that buoy SST is appended to the target (targets and buoys are matched within 24 hours). The SST Matchup Data Base is a geographically organized file of satellite SST and buoy SST matchups where the buoy and satellite match within 100 km and 48 hours.\n\nThe tape is a 9-track, 1600 bpi, unlabeled, odd-parity, binary tape produced on an IBM 360/195 computer. The tape has three physical files, each ending with a physical end-of-file mark. The first file has only one record (physical) which contains information about the data on the tape and serves as a header file. The second file has 4232 physical records of 3150 bytes each which contains the Target Matchup Data Base records. The third file has 900 physical records of 13024 bytes each which contain the SST Matchup Data Base records. The format for both data base files are identical to the disk file formats of these data bases.\n\n  The Office of Satellite Data Processing and Distribution (OSDPC) keeps this data for a month, then sends it to the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) for archiving.  For current data, contact John Sapper at OSDPC,  telephone 301-457-0914 ext.148, e-mail: john.sapper@noaa.gov.  For archived data contact Thomas Ross at NCDC, telephone 828-271-4499, e-mail: tom.ross@noaa.gov.",
