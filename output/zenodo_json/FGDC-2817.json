    "description": "Urea determination data along 5 sections in the Bering Sea perpendicular to\n        the coastline show that the distribution of urea is similar to that of ammonium\n        nitrogen. Accumulation of urea and ammonium was generally observed under\n        the thermocline but the absolute concentration of urea was slightly higher. With\n        the total urea and ammonium content of 7-10 mu g-at N/l in the euphotic\n        layer, 8-10g C/m super(2) organic matter per day may be produced in the\n        process of photosynthesis due to nitrogen recycling.",
