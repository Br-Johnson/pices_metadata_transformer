    "description": "This data set contains mapped sea ice concentrations derived from calibrated brightness temperature data (CBTT) from the Nimbus-5 Electrically Scanning Microwave Radiometer (ESMR).  Sea ice concentration values (expressed in percent ice cover) are binned into 30 km x 30 km grid and averaged.  These monthly and yearly averages are mapped onto 293 x 293 polar stereographic grids for the Arctic and Antarctic regions (90 to 50ï¾¡ N and S).  These maps are available from the National Space Sciences Data Center on one 6250 bpi tape for Arctic data and one for Antarctic.",
