    "description": "On September 12, 1991, at the 121st annual meeting of the American\n     Fisheries Society, more than 150 fisheries scientists, ecologists, and resource\n     managers shared experiences and forged a link between fishery management\n     and marine protected areas. Thirteen formal presentations on marine reserves\n     and fishery refugia catalyzed a lengthy and far-ranging discussion of the\n     potential of refugia as fishery management tools, the strengths and limitations\n     of refugia-based management, existing evidence of refugia efficacy, the need\n     for further testing, and design considerations for fishery refugia. The\n     presentations represented a wide variety of ecological and socioeconomic\n     systems, ranging from tropical coral reef in Western Australia, Florida,\n     Bermuda, and the Cayman Islands, through temperate reef systems in\n     California, New Zealand, and South Australia, to arctic systems in the Bering\n     Sea; crustacean and molluscan fisheries were examined as well as those for\n     temperate and tropical reef finfishes.",
