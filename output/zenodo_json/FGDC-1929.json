    "description": "To evaluate the effects of predation by marine birds and mammals on intermediate and lower trophic levels of subarctic Pacific marine ecosystems, the PICES Working Group 11: 1) obtained and tabulated available data on population sizes and prey consumption by marine birds and mammals; 2) calculated seasonal and annual consumption, expressed as numbers and biomass, of particular marine resource species by particular bird and mammal populations; 3) where possible, stratified the calculation as to age classes of prey and locality (local stock impacted; 4) prepared a report for PICES describing data sources and methods of calculation, and the results, and identifying major lacunae in knowledge.\n\n   [ LC Call No. GC781 .P535 no.14.
