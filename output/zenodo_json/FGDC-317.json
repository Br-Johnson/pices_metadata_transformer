    "description": "The otolith growth pattern of Pollock in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska was studied otolith weight was plotted against fish length and otolith length for each defined area,   i.e. open waters, Pribilof Island, south-east shelf.  Western Gulf of Alaska.  The relationship otolith weight/fish length and otolith weight/otolith length were collected as a power reference were composed and the difference between ships were tested.",
