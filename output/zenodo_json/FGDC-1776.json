    "description": "Phytoplankton data include standing stock and species, and primary production.  The data go back to 1958 and includes cruises to Weather Station P from 1959-1970; American Mail Line cruises along a great circle route from Seattle to Yokohama in 1968-1972; and Japanese, Russian, and U.S. cruises at various times between 1958 and 1974.  The area was divided into geographic zones and the phytoplankton data were tabulated by season for each zone.
