    "description": "This report references biomass and population abundance data of invertebrate communities; population abundance and species composition data of nearshore bird communities; population abundance data of nearshore fish communities; population abundance and species composition data of scoters (Melanitta spp.); population abundance data of sea otters (Enhydra lutris); and bathymetry, current direction, salinity, and temperature data of water from Cook Inlet, Alaska.\n\n  The aforementioned data are referenced in citation: Piatt, J.F.  1994.  Oceanic, shelf and coastal seabird assemblages at the mouth of a tidally-mixed estuary (Cook Inlet, Alaska).  In Publ. Final Rep., Monitoring seabird populations in areas of oil and gas development on the Alaskan continental shelf, OCS Study MMS 93-0015Natl., Biol. Survey, Fish and Wildl. Res. Center, Anchorage, Alaska.\n\n  This literature was collected as part of a metadatabase that represents one or more nearshore resources (from physical attributes such as water and air, to birds and mammals).  Each entry is viewable in three formats, 1) a geospatial explicit format (ArcView 3.3) named GIS ArcView 3.3 Near GEM project, 2) a spreadsheet format (Excel 2002 and within ArcView) named GEM Nearshore Metadata Set, and 3) a ProCite database named GEM Nearshore Metadata References, which consists of references included in 1 and 2 above.  The ProCite database record number corresponds to the Excel Procite Number.  Reference Procite #789 for this literature's metadata.\n\n  The metadata are maintained in digital format (ArcView 3.3, Excel 2002, and Procite) and are available from the Alaska Science Center, USGS in Anchorage, Alaska.\n\n  For a detailed description of the three databases and the project, see \"Bodkin, J. L., and T. Dean.  2003.
