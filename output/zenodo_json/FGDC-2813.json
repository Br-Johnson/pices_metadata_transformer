    "description": "Quaternary basanites were recovered from shallow water depth from the\n        continental margin of the Bering Sea (58 degree 39.0'N, 177 degree\n        12.9'W) near Navarin Basin. The basanites are highly vesicular flow rock and\n        hyaloclastites similar to other alkalic volcanic rocks erupted repeatedly during\n        the late Cenozoic on islands in the Bering Sea region and in mainland Alaska.\n        K-Ar ages for the basanites indicate at least two episodes of volcanism at\n        about 1.1 and 0.4 Ma. Similar alkalic volcanism occurred sporadically at\n        geographically widely separated centers in the Bering Sea region for at least\n        the past 6 Ma. Although some volcanic episodes appear to have occurred\n        roughly synchronously at geographically widely separated centers, no\n        large-scale regional extension nor presence of large mantle plumes are\n        indicated. Instead, alkalic volcanism apparently resulted from upwelling and\n        decompressional melting of small isolated mantle diapirs.",
