    "notes": "Purpose: A lot of the fish we buy in supermarkets or eat in restaurants comes from fish farms, not from the open ocean. But the species that are raised in farms eat a diet of fish from the wild. That's a cause for concern by some people for the long-term impact of harvesting fish from the sea to feed fish in cages. Pete Granger is an aquaculture expert with the Sea Grant program at the University of Washington. He says salmon aquaculture is an example of modern feeding techniques. The salmon, for example, eat food pellets that are a mixture of vegetable matter and ground-up anchovies and other oily fish harvested from the sea.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: None\n\nUse constraints: None\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
