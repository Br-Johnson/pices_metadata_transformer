    "description": "We used satellite-linked time-depth records (SLTDRs) to monitor movements of eight free-ranging adult male northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) in the Bering Sea and North Pacific Ocean during October through January 1993.  We investigated whether the movements of adult male northern fur seals at sea during migration are independent of ocean surface currents by comparing fur seal movements obtained from SLTDRs to the movement of surface currents derived by the numerical model Ocean Surface Current Simulations (OSCURS).",
