    "description": "The food habits of groundfishes in the Bering Sea are presented based on data collected by the National Research Institute of Far Seas Fisheries of Japan.  The ecology and biology of important species caught in fisheries also are described.  Juvenile walleye Pollock (theragra chalcogramma), the most abundant species, preyed primarily on Zooplankton such as euphausiids and copepods.  Zooplankton was also the primary prey of Pacific ocean perch (Sebastes alutus) and Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi).",
