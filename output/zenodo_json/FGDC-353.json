    "description": "The objectives of this workshop are to (1) identify the potential effects and concerns of Alaska  Native regarding the potential effects of climate change on physical environments and wild living resources of particular importance to the subsistence economies and cultures of Alaska Natives; (2) determine the critical unknowns and the research or monitoring programs required to resolve critical unknowns concerning the possible long-term effects of climate change on environments and wild living resources of particular relevance to the subsistence and cultures of Alaska Natives and (3) initiate contingency planning  necessary to be prepared to minimize or mitigate the impacts of climate change on Alaska Native communities that depend upon fish and wildlife resources for subsistence.  The workshop will be organized by the steering committee established by the Marine Mammal Commission.  \n\nAn NPMR project",
