    "description": "Data from merchant ships travelling between British Columbia and Australia, from 1981 to 1988 (Lillooet), 1997-1998 (Western Hawk), 1998-1999 (Australian Current), and 1999-2000, continuing (Packing). Data collected include total carbon dioxide, alkalinity(after 1997), nutrients, chlorophyll a (after 1997), carbon-13 in seawater, atmospheric carbon dioxide (PCO2), and atmospheric carbon-13. Underway measurements include position, time, temperature and salinity",
