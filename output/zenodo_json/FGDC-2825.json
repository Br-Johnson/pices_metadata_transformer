    "description": "Consumption of walleye Pollock Theragra chalcogramma and Pacific herring\n     Clupea pallasii by Groundfish predators in the eastern Bering Sea was\n     quantified and described using data obtained in 1985-88. Groundfish\n     predators considered here include walleye Pollock Theragra chalcogramma;\n     Pacific cod Gadus macrocephalus; yellowfin sole Pleuronectes asper; flathead\n     sole Hippoglossoides elassodon; rock sole Pleuronectes bilineatus; Alaska\n     plaice Pleuronectes quadrituberculatus; arrowtooth flounder Atheresthes\n     stomias; and Greenland turbot Reinhardtius hippoglossoides. Marine mammal\n     and bird consumption of Pollock and herring was estimated for 1985 and\n     compared with Groundfish consumption. Groundfish predation on Pollock\n     during this time period was dominated by cannibalism on age-0 Pollock by\n     adult Pollock. The highest predation rate occurred in 1985 when the largest\n     Pollock year class, as assessed at age 1, during the time period was\n     produced. Predation mortality estimates by age on the 1985 year class were\n     higher than adjacent year classes. Apparently, predators responded to the\n     increased abundance of the 1985 Pollock year class by switching to predation\n     on that year class. The impact of this predation appeared to dampen the size\n     of the 1985 year class at age 3 relative to other adjacent year classes. Marine\n     mammal and bird predation on Pollock was small relative to Pollock\n     cannibalism. However, marine mammal predation on older Pollock was more\n     important, almost doubling the estimated predation mortality rate of age-2 fish.\n     Herring consumption by Groundfish predators tended to be sporadic in time\n     and space and may have depended on encounter rates of herring schools\n     rather than overall biomass. Pacific cod was the most consistent Groundfish\n     predator on herring.",
