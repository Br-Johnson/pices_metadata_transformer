    "description": "Hydrothermal fluid samples collected in 1984, 1987, and 1988 from a large vent field near 47°57N on the Endeavour segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge (JFR)\nhave been analyzed for major and minor elements and gases. There are of the order of 100 individual smoker vents on ~10 large sulfide structures, which are\nlocalized along faults and fault intersections across the vent field. Each sulfide structure has a characteristic fluid composition, which varies very little from one vent\norifice to the next, or from year to year, on a given structure. However, there are large gradients in fluid composition across the vent field, with endmember chlorinity\nincreasing from ~255 mmol/kg in the SW to 505 mmol/kg in the NE. End-member concentrations of major elements are well correlated with chlorinity, and\nendmember volatile concentrations in the lowest chlorinity fluids are approximately twice as high as in the highest chlorinity fluids. The gradients in composition\nacross the vent field and measured vent fluid temperatures >400°C are consistent with supercritical phase separation and loss of brine phase below the seafloor. The\nfactor-of-2 variation in CO (and HS) is larger than expected for loss of a very high-chlorinity brine. Concentrations of iron and manganese are not positively\ncorrelated with chlorinity, suggesting that temperature and pH are more important in controlling metal solubility. Elevated ammonia and bromide/chloride ratios\nindicate that there has been subseafloor interaction between the hydrothermal fluids and organic matter, and high boron concentrations point to a sedimentary\nsource.",
