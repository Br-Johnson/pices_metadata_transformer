    "description": "Project THRUST (Tsunami Hazards Reduction Utilizing Systems Technology) was a demonstration of satellite technology, used with existing tsunami warning\nmethods, to create a low cost, reliable, local tsunami warning system. The major objectives were successfully realized at the end of the demonstration phase in\nSeptember 1987. In June 1988, the Chilean Government held a workshop to assess the value of THRUST to national interests. Two recommendations came forth\nfrom the workshop: (1) the technology was sufficiently reliable and cost-effective to begin the development of an operational prototype and (2) the prototype would\nbe used as the Chilean Tsunami Warning System. As of August 1989, the equipment was in operational use. In September 1989, major improvements were made in\nthe satellite operations that reduced the response time from 88 to 17 sec and enlarged the broadcast area by 50%. The implications of the recent improvements in\nsatellite technology are discussed for application to reductions in disaster impacts.",
