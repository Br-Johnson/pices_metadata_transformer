    "description": "Oil and gas drilling programs in the Alaska Chukchi Sea were carried out on\n     leases offshore from Kasegaluk Lagoon in 1989-91, and further exploration\n     and development activities in this area are likely in future years. We conducted\n     aerial surveys between late July and early September 1989-91 to determine\n     the distribution and abundance of marine birds in the Kasegaluk Lagoon area.\n     We hypothesized that Kasegaluk Lagoon supported an avifauna similar to that\n     found in other lagoon systems in arctic Alaska. In fact, the richness and\n     diversity of bird species using Kasegaluk Lagoon were greater than in lagoon\n     systems in the Beaufort Sea. Brant (Branta bernicla) was the most abundant\n     species in Kasegaluk Lagoon compared to lagoons in the Beaufort Sea,\n     where the Oldsquaw (Clangula hyemalis) is the dominant species. Several\n     other species or species groups, such as Glaucous Gull (Larus hyperboreus),\n     Arctic Tern (Sterna paradisaea), small shorebirds (mainly Calidris and\n     Phalaropus), and Lesser Snow Goose (Chen caerulescens) were also\n     relatively abundant in Kasegaluk Lagoon.",
