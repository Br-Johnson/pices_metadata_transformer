    "description": "Submarine hydrothermal fluids discharge as undiluted, high-temperature jets and as diffuse,highly diluted, low-temperature percolation.\nEstimates of the relative contribution of each discharge type, which are important for the accurate determination of local and global\nhydrothermal budgets, are difficult to obtain directly. In this paper we describe a new method of using measurements of hydrothermal\ntracers such as Fe/Mn, Fe/heat, and Mn/heat in high- temperature fluids, low-temperature fluids, and the neutrally buoyant plume to\ndeduce the relative contribution of each discharge type. We sampled vent fluids from the north Cleft vent field on the Juan de Fuca Ridge\nin 1988, 1989 and 1991, and plume samples every year from 1986 to 1991. The tracers were, on average, 3 to 90 times greater in\nhigh-temperature than in low-temperature fluids, with plume values intermediate. A mixing model calculates that high-temperature fluids\ncontribute only ~3% of the fluid mass flux but >90% of the hydrothermal Fe and >60% of the hydrothermal Mn to the overlying plume.\nThree years of extensive camera-CTD sled tows through the vent field show that diffuse venting is restricted to a narrow fissure zone\nextending for 18 km along the axial strike. Linear plume theory applied to the temperature plumes detected when the sled crossed this\nzone yields a maximum likelihood estimate for the diffuse heat flux of 8.9 ￗ 10  W/m, for a total flux of 534 MW, considering that diffuse\nventing is active along only one-third of the fissure system. For mean low- and high- temperature discharge of 25°C and 319°C,\nrespectively, the discrete heat flux must be 266 MW to satisfy the mass flux partitioning. If the north Cleft vent field is globally\nrepresentative, the assumption that high-temperature discharge dominates the mass flux in axial vent fields leads to an overestimation of the\nflux of many non-conservative hydrothermal species by about an order of magnitude.",
