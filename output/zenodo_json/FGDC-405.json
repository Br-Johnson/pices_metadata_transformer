    "description": "The walleye Pollock is characterized as a generalist species, occupying a broad niche and inhabiting a wide geographic range.  Pollock's local abundance is usually high, dominating the fish biomass in many regional ecosystems.  Thus, it appears to be an adaptable species capable of colonizing marginal habitats.  The fields of macroecology, metapopulation dynamics and genetic population structure are briefly reviewed and information on Pollock is summarized within the framework of these concepts.",
