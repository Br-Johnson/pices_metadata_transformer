    "description": "Surface mooring data from the Bering Sea: Station Inner Front 1.  Data were collected from 1994 through 2004.  Sampled months varied through the years but were usually during April and June.  Air temperature, barometric pressure, salinity, shortwave radiation, temperature, UV vector, vector, and wind speed data were collected at various depths throughout the years using instruments such as MTR, Neil Brown, RCM-9, SEACAT, and WeatherPAK.  53m was the maximum bottom depth.",
