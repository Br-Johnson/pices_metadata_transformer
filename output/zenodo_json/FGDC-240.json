Drifter data may be useful in validating circulation models and in detecting/demonstrating anomalies in the circulation of the North Pacific.\n\nImprovements\n\"Improve access to these data.  Investigate status of software \"\"tools\"\" to extract subsets and summaries.\"\n\nBase Internet/URL\nhttp://www.meds.dfo.ca\n\nA TCODE project",
