    "description": "DMSP F8 SSM/I Monthly Averaged Sea Ice Concentration for the Polar Regions \nfor July 1987 through December 1991 were produced by NSIDC using the daily\nsea ice concentration grids which were generated using the NASATEAM \nalgorithm (Cavalieri, et al. 1986, JGR 91(C1), p. 975-994) and distributed\non CD-ROM by NSIDC.  The monthly sea ice grids are available on request\nvia ftp (see access instructions below), and may eventually be distributed \non CD-ROM with other SSM/I products.  The monthly sea ice grids can be used \nas a mask to block out ice-covered areas for various applications.  To \naccommodate as many  potential applications as possible, the monthly averaged \nice extent was delineated using four concentration values (0%, 5%, 10%, and \n15%) for the minimum concentrations included in the averages.  The grids are \n8-bit raster images containing 448 lines of 304 pixels (304x by 448y) for the\nnorthern hemisphere and 332 lines of 316 pixels (316x by 332y) for the\nsouthern.  IDL procedures were used to calculate monthly averages from the\ndaily-averaged SSM/I grids.  The data were then put into Hierarchical Data\nFormat (HDF).  Utilities to read and manipulate HDF data are available via\nftp from the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA).  The\nNCSA ftp server address is ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu; help is available from\nhelphdf@ncsa.uiuc.edu.",
