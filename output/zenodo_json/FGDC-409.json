    "description": "The Bering Sea is a fascinating region.  The name is conjures up images of ice, marine mammals, severe weather, crab fisheries, Native villages and all these do in fact describe the region.  Noted as extremely productive at the upper trophic levels, the ecological basis for the Bering Sea's teeming biota has long been a puzzle.  The answers are emerging slowly and much of the progress has come about through the kind of coordinated research which we now call an \"ecosystem approach.\"  This section explores the evolution of such research and provides information on some of the significant interdisciplinary programs without trying to provide scientific details.  Rather, the goal and achievements of the work are highlighted.",
