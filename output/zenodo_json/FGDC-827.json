    "description": "A series of six volumes covering Alaska that describe natural and manmade systems. An assembled Planning team made up of resource specialists prepared their respective resource summaries for each of six regions of the state. The sources are a combination of existing and original. Original maps prepared for evaluated resources are currently housed at the Alaska Resource library in the Anchorage Federal Building. General themes include climate, topography, geology, hydrology, soils, biotic communities, cultural resources, land status and services. The intended use of this information was to provide resource information for federal, state, and local planning efforts particularly for land selections under ANILCA. and reflect data current to early 1970's. Volumes 1-Southcentral Region and IV-Southeast Region are applicable to NBS Ecosystem Initiative areas.",
