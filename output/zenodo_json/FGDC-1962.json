    "description": "Fishermen accustomed to the quick boom-then-bust of Alaska's salmon runs may wish they were born in a different timeï¾—about 800 years ago, to be exact. As Doug Schneider reports in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio, scientists studying Alaska lakes have found evidence that the state's salmon booms once lasted centuries, not the mere decades seen today.",

    "notes": "Purpose: Alaska and Canadian scientists published their results in the April 18 issue of the journal Nature. They found that sockeye salmon runs to Alaska once rode waves of abundance lasting centuries. The most recent long-term boom began in the year 1200 and lasted until commercial fishing began in earnest in the 1900s. Bruce Finney is the study's lead author and a marine scientist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks Institute of Marine Science.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: None\n\nUse constraints: None\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
