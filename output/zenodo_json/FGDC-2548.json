    "description": "Bering Sea fixed buoy data were collected by NOAA's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory from September 1975 to July 1982 under the direction  of Dr. James Schumacher.  These data consist of 43 files, where each file represents a single buoy mooring and many contain one or more of the following parameters: air and sea pressure; sea temperature; salinity; and current components.  These files are recorded on a 9-track, 1600 BPI magnetic tape in ASCII code. NOAAServer Codes: [L 65 55 -165 -180] ; nodateline.",
