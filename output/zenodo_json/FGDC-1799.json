    "description": "Single-species stock assessment model developed for the Eastern Bering Sea pollock including predation.  Model spatial coverage is across eastern Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska pollock distributions.  Model inputs are fisheries data and predator biomass. Model outputs pollock population and mortality trends - number at age and biomass at age.  \n\n[ Reference: Livingston, P.A. and R.D. Methot. 1998.
