    "description": "In bottom samples gathered in the vicinity of Bering Island by R/V Mstislav\n     Keldysh during its 22nd voyage, several specimens of Verrucomorpha were\n     found belonging to a new species Altiverruca beringiana sp. n. The new\n     species resembles A. sculpturata Zevina. Before this find, the verrucomorph\n     cirripeds were never known about the 30 degree N latitude in the boreal\n     Pacific. Taking into account earlier data, it can be assumed that the distribution\n     area of this suborder of Cirripedia includes the entire World Ocean.",
