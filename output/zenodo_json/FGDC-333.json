    "description": "In the Northwestern Bering Sea the continental slope is the main element of bottom topography which determines the very high variability of hydrological regime.  The existence of very pronounced Navarin canyon and adjacent ridge results in deviation the Eastern Bering Slope Current (EBSC), formation of anticyclonic or cyclonic eddy in the top of Aleutian Basin (depending on deviation of the Central Branch), development of the Navarin Current which transport waters from the open sea and continental slope to the very vast shallow aquatory of the Anadyr Region.",
