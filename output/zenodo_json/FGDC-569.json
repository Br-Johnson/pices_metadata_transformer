    "description": "Data Type: Elevation; This dataset is a representation of elevation based on 1:250,000 scale digital elevation model (DEM) data obtained from the USGS EROS Alaska Field Office. The data are organized by 1:250,000 scale USGS quadrangles and covers the entire Prince William Sound - Copper River ecosystem. Related data sets include elevation (based on 1:63,360 scale DEM's), a merged and generalized 1:250,000 scale elevation map (elev250g), and shaded relief images.",
