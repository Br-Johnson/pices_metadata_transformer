    "description": "Oceanographic time-series data are available from the Newport (Oregon) Hydrographic Line (44° 40'N) due to efforts by scientists from the Oregon State University (Corvallis, Oregon) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (Newport, Oregon).  Frequent sampling of the hydrography and plankton occurred during the 1960s and early 1970s.  The Newport Hydrographic line is now regularly sampled with 5 cruises per year along the whole line and biweekly cruises to five of the innermost shelf stations.  Climatology of the salinity, temperature and density from 1961-1971 can be seen at http://ltop.oce.orst.edu/~ctd/index.html.  \n\nEuphausiids and larger zooplankton were sampled at night from 1962-1967, at monthly intervals at stations located 5 miles to 85 miles from shore with a 1 m diameter 570 m mesh net.  From 1974 through 1995, a very limited number of CTD measurements and plankton tows were made off the Oregon coast.  Beginning 1996, the Newport Line was once again sampled on a regular basis.  Hydrographic stations located 1, 3, 5, and 10 miles offshore of Newport, OR, were sampled for zooplankton and ichthyoplankton at biweekly intervals from June 1969 - August 1972.  Water depths at these stations are 20 m, 45 m, 60 m, and 80 m.  In addition zooplankton were sampled on a biweekly monthly basis during May - September 1973, May and August 1974, July - August 1977, May - August 1978, and May - September 1983.  Most of this work was carried out using 20 cm bongo nets fitted with 240  µm mesh nets and towed obliquely throughout the water column. The only hydrographic data available are sea surface temperature and salinity.  In addition, the 5-mile station was sampled year-round in 1991 and during summer months of 1990 and 1992, using 0.75 m diameter 333 µm mesh nets towed vertically.  Sampling off Newport Oregon (44° 40'N) resumed in May 1996, with sampling at stations 1, 5, 10 and 15 miles from shore at biweekly intervals.   \n\n\n[ Reference: PICES Scientific Report No. 18 2001, Proceedings of the PICES/CoML/IPRC Workshop on \"Impact of Climate Variability on Observation and Prediction of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes in the North Pacific\", http://www.pices.int/publications/scientific_reports/Report18/default.aspx. ]",
