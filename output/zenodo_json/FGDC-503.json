    "description": "This project involves employing a new stable nitrogen isotope labeling technique for measuring denitrification rates in surface sediments of the Bering Continental Shelf using an existing shipboard core incubation system. Two existing ship time commitments in the summer of 1999 will be used to undertake the field research with follow-up laboratory analyses in 1999-2000. Based upon recent work, we expect that sediment-based processes can directly decrease concentrations of nitrate in overlying waters on large, shallow shelves. For example, in a paper recently published in the Journal of Geophysical Research (Vol. 104: 7827-7836, April 15, 1999), we provide evidence that 5 to 20% of nitrate currently brought onto the northern Bering Shelf may be lost through denitrification before export off the shelf in the Chukchi Sea. This sediment-based process therefore can have a significant impact on overall ecosystem fertility, and directly impact the biomass of higher trophic levels sequestered within commercially important fisheries and marine mammal populations utilized for subsistence.  The development of spatially extensive estimates of denitrification rates on the Bering continental shelf will improve our understanding of overall carbon and nitrogen cycling in the productive water, and therefore contribute to the North Pacific Marine Research program's goals of developing predictive capabilities for ecological response to expected global change.
