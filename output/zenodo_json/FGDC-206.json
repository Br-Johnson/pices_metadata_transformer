Mountains and Pacific Coast. These regional annual statistics may be useful in describing long term trends, although the data are aggregated along a large north-south area.\"\n\nImprovements\nIf useful, these data could be provide on-line and updated annually\n\nBase Internet/URL\nhttp:/www.ec.gc.ca\n\n[ A TCODE project ]",
