    "description": "This Eastern Bering Sea Shelf model breaks down the Eastern Bering Sea Shelf Model 1 into more detailed species groupings to tease apart the dynamics of individual species, especially in the commercially important groundfish.   Spatial extensions to the model include sub-dividing into Inner, Middle and Outer Biophysical Domains.  The model will be calibrated with respect to top-down and bottom-up forcing using \"checkpoint\" food webs for several years in the 1990s, and using 1979-1998 time-series of trawl data and MSVPA/other assessment analyses.  \n\n[ Reference: PICES Scientific Report No. 18 2001, Proceedings of the PICES/CoML/IPRC Workshop on \"Impact of Climate Variability on Observation and Prediction of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes in the North Pacific\", http://www.pices.int/publications/scientific_reports/Report18/default.aspx. ]",
