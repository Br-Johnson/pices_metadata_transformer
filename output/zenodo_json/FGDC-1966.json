    "description": "The Steller sea lion is listed as an endangered species in much of Alaska. And while scientists search for ways to help the species recover, a potential problem looms on the horizon. As Doug Schneider reports in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio, California sea lions are becoming frequent visitors to the state.",

    "notes": "Purpose: Mounted high on a cliff overlooking the rocks of Chiswell Island, a popular Steller sea lion rookery in the northern Gulf of Alaska, a video camera sends images of sea lions coming and going from the island directly to the Alaska SeaLife Center, some 35 miles away in Seward. It was while watching video of the rookery that SeaLife Center researcher John Maniscalco first noticed something odd about some of the sea lions.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: None\n\nUse constraints: None\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
