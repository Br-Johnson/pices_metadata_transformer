    "description": "Data Type: Exxon Valdez Oil Spill;  GIS database produced as a result of the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill (EVOS) for Natural Resources Damage Assessment (NRDA). Data was collected under the supervision of the Alaska Department of Environment Conservation (ADEC) with the goal to map and monitor all know locations of beached oil. The summer 1989 shoreline oiling ADEC used low-altitude aerial observations. The scale is 1:63,360. The intended purpose of this database is to provide a resource for use in the oil spill damage identification, oil spill response, habitat restoration activities.",
