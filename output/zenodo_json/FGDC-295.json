    "notes": "Purpose: The purpose of the in situ nitrate data collection was to assess the dynamics of nitrate enrichment processes at the 70m isobath of the SE Bering Sea shelf.  This will provide a relatively long term period of high density measurements that can be compared to physical and biological measurements being collected concurrently.\n\nStatus: In Progress\n\nMaintenance frequency: Continually\n\nAccess constraints: All data available one year after collection.\n\nUse constraints: No use constraints after one year of collection other than\ngiving proper citation to the data origin.\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system. NOAA makes no warranty, expressed or implied, nor does the fact of distribution constitute such a warranty.\n\nFGDC metadata date: 19991028\n\nFGDC metadata standard: Content Standards for Digital Geospatial Metadata\n\nFGDC metadata version: FGDC-STD-001-1998\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
