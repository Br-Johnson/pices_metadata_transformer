    "description": "Data Type: Oceans/Coasts;   A data set of AVHRR derived sea surface temperature for the SEA study area. This project is not yet complete. The aim of the project is to develop an annual spring through summer time-series of ocean temperatures for 1985-1990. These layers are being produced using the same protocols as that being used by Dr. David Eslinger and his students at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) to process daily sea surface temperature under another project. Eventually, they hope to integrate the two data sets into one uninterrupted series.",
