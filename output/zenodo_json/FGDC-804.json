    "description": "Data Type: Base Maps  ;This file contains latitude and longitude lines for every degree spanning the state. The coverage contains two annotation subclasses anno2mil and mapbox. Anno2mil (1:250,000 annotations serve as map graticule for standard Series E map size) can be used to draw labels for the even degrees around the border of statewide maps. Mapbox (1:250,000 annotations serve as map graticule for oversized Series E map) can be used to draw labels for the even degrees around the border of DNR's oversized statewide maps which depict the entire Aleutian Island chain.",
