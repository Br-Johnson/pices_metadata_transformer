    "description": "Data Type: Base Maps;   The DCW is a vector basemap of the world at a scale of 1:1,000,000 developed by ESRI for ARC/INFO. The database consists of geographic, attribute, and textual data that is divides the world into 2,094 fifteen by fifteen degree tiles that are each subdivided into five by five degree tiles. Over 200 attributes are included in 17 thematic layers. The DCW is 1.7 gigabytes in size distributed on four CD-ROMs. There is an Alaska module to this dataset that is available, that consists of all available layers covering only the State of Alaska. Grid-arendal Global Resource Information database sponsored by the United Nations have produced a similar subsection of the DCW for the polar region of the world, north of 45 degree latitude. The potential user will need to consult the DCW data dictionary for a complete review of database contents.",
