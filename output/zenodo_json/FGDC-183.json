By examining this relationship over multiple years and transects (day and night) we hope to better understand the source of Pollock year class strength in this Pollock nursery area.\n\nStatus: In Progress\n\nMaintenance frequency: As Needed\n\nAccess constraints: The data have been processed and require special access programs and software, contact Contributor\n\nUse constraints: None\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
