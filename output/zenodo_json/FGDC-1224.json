    "description": "The equatorial oceans are the dominant oceanic source of CO to the atmosphere, annually amounting to a net flux of 0.7-1.5 Pg (10 g) of carbon, up to 72% of\nwhich emanates from the equatorial Pacific Ocean. Limited observations indicate that the size of the equatorial Pacific source is significantly influenced by El Ni￱o\nevents, but the effect has not been well quantified. Here we report spring and autumn multiannual measurements of the partial pressure of CO in the surface ocean\nand atmosphere in the equatorial Pacific region. During the 1991-94 El Ni￱o period, the derived net annual sea-to-air flux of CO was 0.3 Pg C from autumn 1991\nto autumn 1992, 0.6 Pg C in 1993, and 0.7 Pg C in 1994. These annual fluxes are 30-80% of that of 1996, a non-El-Ni￱o year. The total reduction of the regional\nsea-to-air CO flux during the 1991-95 El Ni￱o period is estimated to account for up to one-third of the atmospheric anomaly (the difference between the annual\nand long-term-average increases in global atmospheric CO content) observed over the same period.",
