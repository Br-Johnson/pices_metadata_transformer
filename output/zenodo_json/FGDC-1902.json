    "description": "The data in the provided files are the ETOPO5 gridded elevation data for the Earth, subsetted for the Arctic area above 50 degrees North.  The data were provided to NSIDC for this project by Michael S. Loughridge and George F. Sharman at the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC), Boulder, Colorado.  \n\nFor further information about the ETOPO5 data set, and for access to the full data set and other subsetting and data formatting options, please see: http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/seltopo.html.  \n\nThe elevation data in the files whole_arctic.bin, east_arctic.bin, and west_arctic.bin are 2-byte, signed, big-endian integer values representing meters above sea level (i.e. negative values are below sea level).  They are 1-band image files with no header.  \n\nThe data are also available as ArcInfo (vs. 8.0.1) grids, which have been tarred as directories to include the requisite info directory, or as ASCII files in row-major order (with ArcInfo headers, which may be stripped if unnecessary for your needs).",
