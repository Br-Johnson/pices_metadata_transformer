    "description": "Data Type: Elevation;  This layer contains slope data at 1:63,360 scale for Prince William Sound, the Copper River Delta, and eastern Kenai Peninsula. Pacific GIS derived this slope coverage from a digital elevation model (DEM) acquired from the Chugach National Forest. The data is available both divided along 250,000 scale quad boundaries, and as a merged data set. Related data sets include slope derived from 1:250,000 scale DEM's and elevation data sets.",
