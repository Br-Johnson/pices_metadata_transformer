    "description": "The conditions sufficient for phytoplankton blooms were determined for five domains with different water structure in the northwest part of the Japan Sea: Polar Front, Subarctic, Primorye Current, Coastal and small Pre-Estuarine one (near Suyfun River estuary).  Irregular CTD data and the data of plankton net samples (net mouth 0.1 m2, mesh size 0.183 mm, towing 0-100 m) obtained in 1988 - 1998 were used for the analysis (about 700 samples). Note :phytoplankton cells are able to be collected by this net when blooming only.",
