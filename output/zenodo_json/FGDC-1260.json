    "notes": "Purpose: Several times each week, crab researchers Pete Cummiskey and Eric Munk make the short drive from the fishing town of Kodiak, Alaska, out past the U.S. Coast Guard base to Womens Bay, a picturesque inlet that at this time of year is surrounded by snowcapped hills and mountains. \n\nThey launch their small inflatable skiff and motor a short ways off shore. Cutting the engine, they lower a device called a sonar signal receiver into the water. The receiver picks up the sound from tiny transmitters glued to the shells of four juvenile red king crab. After a few minutes, Munk and Cummiskey figure they're close to the tagged crabs. They put scuba tanks over their dry suits and slip over the side into the ocean.\n\nForty feet beneath the surface, Munk and Cummiskey have found more than the four crab they fitted with transmitters. They've homed in on a giant, tangled ball of crab literally thousands of them on the sea floor. Cummiskey has seen this behavior before. It's called a crab pod.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required.\n\nUse constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
