    "description": "Bathymetric contours were generated from soundings collected during geophysical surveys conducted by the USGS from 1969 to 1982, and supplemented by data from other sources. The region covered by the map is the Chukchi Sea from the Bering Strait north to the Arctic Ocean, and Point Barrow, Alaska west to Herald Island, Russia. The map stops just east of Wrangel Island, Russia. Bathymetry is in meters, including 10 meter contour intervals from 10 to 100 meters, and 100 meter contour intervals at depths greater than 100 meters.",
