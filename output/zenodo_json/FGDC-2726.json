    "description": "As part of a multiyear program responding to the needs of petroleum development of the Alaskan outer continental shelf, a comprehensive study of the distribution and chemical composition of suspended material was initiated. The purpose of the study was to determine the chemical nature and transport pathways of particulate materials that would\nact as effective scavengers of petroleum compounds in the marine waters of the Alaskan continental shelf. This report summarizes the major results of studies conducted in four separate continental shelf regions: the northeast Gulf of Alaska, lower Cook Inlet, southeastern Bering Sea Shelf, and Norton Sound.",
