    "description": "Emissions of sulfur gases from both natural and anthropogenic sources strongly influence the chemistry of the atmosphere. To assess the relative importance of these sources we have combined the measurements of sulfur gases and fluxes during the past decade to create a global emission inventory. The inventory, which is divided\ninto 12 latitude belts, takes into account the seasonal dependence of sulfur emissions from biogenic sources. The total emissions of sulfur gases from natural sources are approximately 0.79 Tmol S/a. These emissions are 16% of the total sulfur emissions in the Northern Hemisphere and 58% in the Southern Hemisphere. The inventory clearly shows the impact of anthropogenic sulfur emissions in the region between 35° and 50°N.",
