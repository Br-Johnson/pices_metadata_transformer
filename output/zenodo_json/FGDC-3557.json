    "description": "This direct-access disk file contains daily sets of fields of the heat budget parameter generated by the heat budget Product Component. The file accumulates daily sets of data such that it will always contain data for the most recent 37 days. Each daily set of data contains polar stereo and 2.5 X 2.5 degree arrays of day and night longwave radiation and absorbed solar radiation. These are also polar stereo arrays of available solar energy. The file is made up of logical records in two lengths, 31,250 and 20,736 bytes. The longer record occupies 5 blocks and the shorter record 4 blocks.\n\n  The Office of Satellite Data Processing and Distribution (OSDPC) keeps this data for a month, then sends it to the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) for archiving.  For current data, contact John Sapper at OSDPC,  telephone 301-457-0914 ext.148, e-mail: john.sapper@noaa.gov.  For archived data contact Thomas Ross at NCDC, telephone 828-271-4499, e-mail: tom.ross@noaa.gov.",
