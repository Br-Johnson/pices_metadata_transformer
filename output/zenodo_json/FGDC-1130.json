    "description": "What is EPIC? EPIC is many things all designed to work with in situ data sets. For the researcher, EPIC provides a large selection of high quality analysis tools for\nmany different types of data (time series, CTD, ADCP, XBT, bottle, etc.). For the programmer, it provides a single application program interface (C, Fortran, and\nMATLAB) to multiple data formats (netCDF, Classic EPIC, and hpf format). For the database manager, it provides tools for the loading of meta data into a\ndatabase and formatting the results from a researcher's query into a format that can be directly used by the EPIC analysis tools. For the webmaster, EPIC provides\na set of tools to access and display data in real time. EPIC was developed at NOAA's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory to manage the large numbers of\nhydrographic and time series oceanographic in situ data sets collected as part of the NOAA climate study programs, such as EPOCS and TOGA in earlier years,\nWOCE, CLIVAR and others more recently. At present, PMEL maintains approximately 100,000 individual data sets in the EPIC data base. These data are\navailable on-line to researchers inside PMEL on the desktop and can be provided on PMEL's intranet utilizing EPIC Web utilities.",
