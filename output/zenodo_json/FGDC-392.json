    "description": "The distribution of components of the carbonate system in the western Bering Sea were mapped during 15-25 June 1992.  The results were based on an assessment of total alkalinity and pH collected during the twenty-first cruise of the R/V Akademik Alexander Nesmeyanov.  Variability of total inorganic carbon down to minimum oxygen depths was analyzed and found to be a result of production/destruction processes and gas exchange.    Maximum vertical changes of inorganic carbon were recorded at the boundary between the upper quasi-homogeneous and cold intermediate water and deep at all stations in the study area.",
