    "description": "Subsurface mooring data from Gore Point, Gulf of Alaska: Station Gore Point 34.  Data were collected from 1994 through 2004.  Sampled months varied through the years but were usually during February, May, and September.  Fluorometer, salinity, temperature, and UV vector data were collected at various depths throughout the years using instruments such as RCM-4, RCM-7, RCM-9, and SEACAT.  145m was the maximum bottom depth.",
