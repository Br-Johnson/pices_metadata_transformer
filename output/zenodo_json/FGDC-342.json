    "description": "This project will synthesize existing data on the status of the Pacific walrus population and further refine a sampling protocol for monitoring the productivity and juvenile survival of the population. Age and sex composition data collected in six research cruises in the early 1980s and one in 1998 will be analyzed to determine trends in population growth over the past two decades. Potential sources of bias in those data will be analyzed, and corrected data will be used in a cohort analysis.  In July 1999, we shall again sample the age and sex composition of walruses on the ice edge of the Chukchi Sea from an icebreaker. A cruise on the same vessel in September 1998 indicated poor productivity and/or juvenile survival for at least the past 3 years. Those results indicate that the population has been declining in the late 1990s as it was in the early 1980s. The 1999 sample will determine whether the decline is continuing and will provide an opportunity to further refine the method of collecting age and sex composition data for Pacific walruses. Specifically, we shall provide recommendations to management agencies for an efficient and affordable method of monitoring population trends in between periodic population surveys.  This project also includes;  Brian Taras, Biometrician for Solid Solutions\n\nAn NPMR project",
