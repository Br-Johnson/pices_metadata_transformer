    "description": "The chemical composition and seasonal distribution of suspended particulate matter collected during 1977 and 1978 in lower Cook Inlet and northwestern Shelikof\nStrait are compared with published data on current patterns. With respect to suspended-matter dispersal patterns, Cook Inlet shows characteristics of both an\nestuary and an embayment. Estuarine characteristics are exemplified by the association of the inorganic terrestrial material from upper Cook Inlet with the\noutward-flowing estuarine water. Plots of total suspended-matter concentrations versus salinity for surface and near-bottom waters are roughly linear for the central\nregion of lower Cook Inlet, indicating that dilution of the estuarine water by relatively nonturbid oceanic water is the major factor controlling suspended-matter\nconcentrations in the inlet. Embayment characteristics are indicated by the cross-channel suspended-matter gradients and by the elemental ratios of the particulate\nmatter, which show evidence for movement of Copper River-derived aluminosilicate material across the mouth of the inlet and into Shelikof Strait. These features,\nwhich are unique to lower Cook Inlet, are a direct result of the unusual nature of the current patterns existing within the inlet.",
