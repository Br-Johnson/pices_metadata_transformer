    "description": "This paper applies an age-structured stochastic recruitment model to the Pacific whiting fishery off the North American Pacific continental shelf.  A policy algorithm has been developed as an aid to management of the fishery.  The algorithm aims to set quotas in such a way as to use strong year-classes in a practical and efficient manner while protecting the stock when it is in a poor condition and environmental conditions do not appear to be conducive to stock improvement in the immediate future.",
