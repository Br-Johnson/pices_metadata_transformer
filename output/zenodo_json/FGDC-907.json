    "description": "The Continuous Plankton Recorder is towed on a transect from Vancouver to Japan (through the southern Bering Sea) in April, June and September/October. The transect is divided up into discrete plankton samples, each 18kms long. Every fourth collected sample is processed for hard-shelled phytoplankton and mesozooplankton (principally crustacea). Organisms are identified to the highest practicable taxonomic level and levels of abundance are recorded for each taxon. All samples are archived. The data are stored as counts of each taxon together with time, date and location of collection of the mid-point of the sample.    \n\nPlease see also Metadata ID 5202 for another north Pacific CPR project.  \n\n[ An NPMR project ]   \n\n[ Reference: PICES Scientific Report No. 18 2001, Proceedings of the PICES/CoML/IPRC Workshop on \"Impact of Climate Variability on Observation and Prediction of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes in the North Pacific\", http://www.pices.int/publications/scientific_reports/Report18/default.aspx. ]",
