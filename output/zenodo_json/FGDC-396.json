    "description": "The process of efficient biological pumping with high biological productivity was determined for the Bering Sea by employing a long-term time series sediment trap deployed during 1990-1995.  The present Bering Sea is an efficiency atmospheric CO2 sink with significant drawdown of the CO2.  The high efficiency attributes to markedly high opal content of 69% in total mass flux, which is followed by 13% calcium carbonate content.",
