    "description": "ICEWATCH is the first joint project in earth observation between Russian Space Agency (RKA) and European Space\nAgency (ESA). The overall objective of the project is to implement satellite monitoring by combined use of ESA ERS SAR,\nRKA Okean SLR and other remote sensing data to support ice navigation in the Northern Sea Route (NSR), offshore\nindustry and environmental studies. ERS-1 SAR images have been used in ice monitoring of the NSR in several\ndemonstration campaigns since 1991. The experience from use of SAR data onboard Russian icebreakers to assist in ice\nnavigation is very positive although ERS-1 can only provide data in selected parts of the NSR with a limited swath width of\n100 km. In the ICEWATCH project a concept for integrating ERS SAR data in the Russian ice monitoring service is\ndemonstrated where Okean SLR data are included. The system is currently tested in pilot demonstration phase before it\nis planned to become operational. In addition to data acquisition and interpretation techniques for data integration, ice\nclassification and data transmission techniques have been tested. Also user requirements have been investigated,\nsuggesting that there are many new and potential users of SAR ice information in the NSR. In future other radar satellites\nwill also be used such as ESA ENVISAT which will be launched in 1999. The first results of ICEWATCH were presented at\nthe Second ERS Applications Workshop in London in December 1995 (Johannessen et al., 1996).",
