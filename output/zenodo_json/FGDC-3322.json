    "description": "This report references population abundance and species composition data of black oystercatchers (Haematopus bachmani), goldeneyes (Bucephala islandica), harlequin ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus), and scoters (Melanitta spp.) and species composition data of algal species: Fucus distichus, Laminaria spp., and Zostera marina; fish species: Ammodytes hexapterus and Clupea pallasi; and invertebrate species: Clinocardium nuttali, Evasterias troschelii, Mytilus trossulus, Protothaca staminea, Pycnopodia helianthoides, Saxidomus giganteus, and Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis from Womens Bay, Kodiak Island, Alaska.\n\n  The aforementioned data are referenced in citation: Nishimoto, M.F., D. Ferrell, W.M. Crayton, and R. Jackson.  1985.  A reconnaissance of the nearshore waters of Women's Bay, Kodiak Island.  U.S. Fish and Wildl. Serv., Alaska Maritime Natl. Wildl. Refuge, Homer, Alaska.\n\n  This literature was collected as part of a metadatabase that represents one or more nearshore resources (from physical attributes such as water and air, to birds and mammals).  Each entry is viewable in three formats, 1) a geospatial explicit format (ArcView 3.3) named GIS ArcView 3.3 Near GEM project, 2) a spreadsheet format (Excel 2002 and within ArcView) named GEM Nearshore Metadata Set, and 3) a ProCite database named GEM Nearshore Metadata References, which consists of references included in 1 and 2 above.  The ProCite database record number corresponds to the Excel Procite Number.  Reference Procite #718 for this literature's metadata.\n\n  The metadata are maintained in digital format (ArcView 3.3, Excel 2002, and Procite) and are available from the Alaska Science Center, USGS in Anchorage, Alaska.\n\n  For a detailed description of the three databases and the project, see \"Bodkin, J. L., and T. Dean.  2003.
