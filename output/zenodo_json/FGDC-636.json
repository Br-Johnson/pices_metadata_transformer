    "description": "Data Type: Boundaries; This layer includes data on protected areas in the Prince William Sound - Copper River ecosystem including Wild and Scenic Rivers, State Marine Parks, conservation lands designated under the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA), and State of Alaska Legislatively Designated Areas (LDAs). Pacific GIS built this layer by merging data from the Alaska Department of Natural Resources (DNR), the Chugach National Forest, and the National Park Service. Land protection is a relative, rather than absolute concept; uses that would be allowed under one level of protective status (such as logging in a National Forest) would be prohibited in other types of designation (such as wilderness areas within a National Park). The protected areas layer includes\nsufficient information on specific designations within larger jurisdictions to allow relative ratings of protection to be developed. For additional information regarding land ownership and land status please see the documentation for the LANDOWN coverage.",
