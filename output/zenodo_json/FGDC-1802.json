    "description": "Multispecies virtual population analysis  (MSVPA) model for the Bering Sea, includes predation interactions among several commercially important groundfish stocks, and also predation by arrowtooth flounder and northern fur seal on these stocks.  The modeled region is the eastern Bering Sea shelf and slope north to about 61N.  Model inputs are fisheries, predator biomass, and food habits data.  The model requires estimates of other food abundance supplied by species outside the model.  The model outputs age-structured population dynamics for key species numbers at age.  \n\n[ Reference: Livingston, P.A. and Jurado-Molina J. 2000.
