    "description": "This pulication reviews of the state of knowledge of harmful algal blooms (HABs) in the six PICES member countries of the North Pacific (Canada, Japan, Peopleï¾’s Republic of China, the Republic of Korea, Russia and the United States of America) plus Mexico, up to 2001. Both HABs harming humans due to the consumption of contaminated marine products and those harming marine life are involved; both have major economic and social impacts. The reports summarize the impacts and provide insights into the understanding of the ecology of HABs in northern Pacific countries. All nations report severe HAB problems, often due to the same species of algae. These problems appear to be chronic in some countries, and worsening in others; the severity of HABs will likely continue into the foreseeable future. The need and potential value of co-operation in this and other similarly-affected regions is emphasized in this report.\n\n\n   [ LC Call No. GC781 .P535 no.23.  ISBN 097314923X ]",
