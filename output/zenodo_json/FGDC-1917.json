    "description": "The Workshop addressed the responses of the subarctic Pacific to forcing by climate variations and human activities. The time scales considered were seasons to centuries.  The first workshop objective was to suggest current and future long-term monitoring programs to describe significant forcing and responses.  Second was to suggest scientific, technological and other factors that affect the above monitoring programs, and third, was to provide a summary report that advised on the strategy for developing a monitoring program.    \n\n[ LC Call No. GC781 .P535 no.3.
