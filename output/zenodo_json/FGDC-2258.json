We do not maintain records of these publications but may be able to direct a user to the appropriate individual(s) for specific topics.  The Institute of Marine Science Publications Group maintains a list of those publications processed by them.\n\nStatus: In Progress\n\nMaintenance frequency: Unknown\n\nAccess constraints: None\n\nUse constraints: None\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
