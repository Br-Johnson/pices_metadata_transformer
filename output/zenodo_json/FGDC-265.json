    "description": "Parameter\nSST from AVHRR\n\nMeasurement Details\n\"SST measurements from AVHRR instrument on polar orbiting weather satellites.  Spatial resolution is about 1 km (at nadir). Cloud cover is a SERIOUS limitation to this data set.  Calibration of satellite data to actual sea surface temperature values requires some \"\"ground-truth\"\" (can be provided from the buoy system). Satellite pass images are reviewed and rectified images are produced for selected areas when cloud cover permits.  Cloud cover makes the data archive heavily biased towards summer images.\"\n\nGeographic Area\nCalifornia coast to Beaufort Sea\n\nIOSPBS Data Distribution\nSearchable database of images (by time, area) available at IOS. Images are retrieved from off-line storage on request.\n\nPSARC_Utility\n\"Limited use (directly) in stock assessment. Satellite images provide areal coverage that is helpful in interpreting the significance of \"\"fixed point\"\" measurements such as lighthouse or buoy measurements.\"\n\nImprovements\n\"On-line searchable inventory of images would be useful, particularly if low-resolution \"\"quick look\"\" images could be incorporated.\"\n\n[ A TCODE project ]",
