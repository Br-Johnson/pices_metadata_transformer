    "description": "When you think of cities with bad air, perhaps places like Los Angeles spring to mind. But few of us would ever think of Fairbanks, Alaska set amid glaciers, wilderness and\nwildlife as a city with some of the nation's worst air. As Doug Schneider reports in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio, the city is making a noble effort to clean up its act.",

    "notes": "Purpose: It's just before 8 a.m. rush hour in Fairbanks,  Alaska. The temperature this day is 25ï¾°F below zero. The dry, bitterly cold air has spawned what locals call ice fog. Ice fog is\na sometimes dangerous, ground-hugging cloud of everything that comes out of each chimney, smokestack and vehicle tailpipe in town things like wood smoke, coal soot, water  vapor, and a virtual cocktail of potentially harmful chemicals like carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and sulfur dioxide, to name a few.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required.\n\nUse constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
