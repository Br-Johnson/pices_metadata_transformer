    "description": "Data Type: Vegetation/Land Cover/Soils;  Soil survey data intended to serve the needs of a broad range of users. This theme contains information useful in large-scale planning. Of primary importance are the predictions of soil behavior for selected land uses. Also highlighted are inherent limitations or hazards of the soils for land uses and the impact that selected land uses will have on the environment. Suitability ratings are given for such uses as common crops, rangeland for cattle and sheep and reindeer, commercial forestry, road locations, low buildings, recreation and off-road trafficability.",
