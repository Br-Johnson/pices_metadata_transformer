    "description": "Recent investigations of the Davidson Seamount off central California using a remotely operated vehicle have revealed communities rich with deep-sea corals.  During these observations several corals were collected and three colonies were made available for an age and growth study.  The colonies examined in this study were identified as bubblegum coral (Paragorgia sp.), precious pink coral (Corallium sp.), and bamboo coral (Keratoisis sp.).  Age was estimated from growth zone counts made in skeletal cross sections.  These age estimages were used to estimate growth rates, and ultimately colony age and perhaps longevity.  To validate the growth rate estimate from growth zone counts a radiometric method called a lead-210 dating was used to determine an independent growth rate for each colony.  Agreement of growth rates derived from growth zone counts and lead-210 dating were used as an indicator of age estimate accruacy.  Growth rates determined for each species were quire different.  The bubblegum coral had a relatively high growth rate, with the precious pink coral being somewhat intermediate and the bamboo coral being the slowest growing\n\n[ Co-PIs: Gregor M.
