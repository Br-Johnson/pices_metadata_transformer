    "description": "DMSP F8 SSM/I ice concentrations are daily first-year, multi-year, and \ntotal ice, 25 x 25 km polar stereographic grids, north and south polar \nregions, output from two algorithms: NASA Team algorithm (Cavalieri et \nal. 1986; 1994 in prep.), and Comiso \"Bootstrap\" algorithm (Comiso 1994\nin prep.).  Input data are orbital antenna temperatures processed to gridded \nbrightness temperatures.  Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) \nF8 platform carried this first functional Special Sensor Microwave/Imager \ninstrument, a linearly-polarized passive microwave radiometric system at \n85.5 GHz V/H, 37.0 GHz V/H, 22.2 GHz V, 19.3 GHz V/H. Two CD-ROMs contain \nall F8 SSM/I ice concentrations, 9 July 1987 - 31 December 1991 (NP \nfiles = 137202 bytes, SP files = 105922 bytes, in HDF.  Software to read\nand manipulate HDF are available from National Center for Supercomputing\nApplications (NCSA) via ftp (ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu). Other public domain and \ncommercial software packages, such as IDL, are available that can read and \nmanipulate HDF.  SSM/I CD-ROMs are presently being distributed at no charge, \nwith first priority for the NASA and NASA-funded research communities.  \nThis distribution policy is subject to change without notice; please inquire.  \nNSIDC is processing DMSP F11 SSM/I in the same grid/projection.\n\nThe primary archive and distribution source for DMSP SSM/I swath\n(orbital) data (level 1b) is NOAA/NESDIS Satellite Data Services Division,\nPrinceton Executive Square, Room 100, Washington, DC 20233; telephone\n301-763-8402.",
