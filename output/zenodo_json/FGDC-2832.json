    "description": "Two species of the hippolytid genus Heptacarpus, H. maxillipes (Rathbun,\n     1902) and H. moseri (Rathbun, 1902), both of which have been known\n     mainly from the eastern Pacific Ocean including the Bering Sea, are recorded\n     from Japan for the first time on the basis of specimens collected from the\n     Pacific coast of northern Japan. The identification was confirmed by\n     comparison with American specimens. For each species, a synonymy and\n     detailed description, including the color pattern of fresh material, are given",
