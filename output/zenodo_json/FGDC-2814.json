    "description": "Gastrointestinal tract contents were evaluated from 73 female and juvenile\n        male northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) for analysis of their diet in the\n        Bering Sea. Fur seals were collected from August to October of 1981,\n        1982, and 1985. Juvenile walleye Pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) and\n        gonatid squid were the primary prey. Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) and\n        capelin (Mallotus villosus), considered important fur seal prey in previous\n        reports, were absent from the diet. Prey species and size varied among years\n        and between nearshore and pelagic sample locations. Interannual variation in\n        the importance of Pollock in the diet of fur seals was positively related to\n        year-class strength of Pollock. Midwater (n=23) and bottom (n=116) trawls\n        were conducted at the location of fur seal collections to determine availability\n        of fish and squid relative to prey species eaten by fur seals. The species and\n        size composition of prey taken by fur seals was similar to midwater trawl\n        collections, but differed from bottom trawl catches. Contrary to earlier\n        conclusions that northern fur seals are opportunistic in their feeding habits, we\n        conclude that fur seals are size-selective midwater feeders during the summer\n        and fall in the eastern Bering Sea.",
