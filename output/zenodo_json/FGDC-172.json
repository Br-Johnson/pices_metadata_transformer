    "description": "The goal of this project is to provide climate researchers with sophisticated routines and procedures for management, visualization and analysis of ocean hydrographic data sets, in order to obtain a basic description of the physical properties and circulation of the ocean. Understanding climate change depends on detailed scientific knowledge of the ocean and it's interaction with the atmosphere. Much has been learned about atmospheric circulation patterns. However, the ability to make climate predictions months in advance and to project climate change over periods of years to decades requires an understanding of the role of ocean circulation and the interaction of the ocean with the atmosphere. The goal of this project is to enable such research by providing the climate researcher with sophisticated data management, visualization and analysis procedures for oceanic hydrographic data, in support of the cross cutting science efforts required for assessment and prediction of annual and decadal climate variations and changes.",
