    "description": "Four years (1 January 1973 through 31 December 1976) of Arctic and\nAntarctic sea ice conditions, derived from Nimbus-5 Electrically\nScanning Microwave Radiometer (ESMR) brightness temperatures (TB), are\nmapped on polar stereographic grids enclosing the 50 degree north and\n50 degree south latitude circles. Grid size varies from about 32 by 32\nkm at the poles to about 28 by 28 km at 50 degrees. Sea ice\nconcentrations were calculated from TBs for each grid point with an\nalgorithm that uses an emissivity value of 0.92 and an ice physical\ntemperature estimate from climatological surface air temperatures.\n\nMonthly, multiyear monthly and yearly grids of TB's and sea ice\nconcentrations were created for 1973-1976, except for seven months for\nwhich usable data were insufficient.  Three-day averaged TB grids are\nalso available for both hemispheres (two tapes per hemisphere.)  Data\nproduced by H.J. Zwally, C.L. Parkinson, J.C. Comiso, all of\nNASA/Goddard Space Flight Center.  Published atlases for Arctic and\nAntarctic are available (NASA SP-489, 1987 and NASA-SP-459, 1983,\nrespectively.)  Data available via ftp, or can be packaged on 4mm or\n8mm tape; data reports provided with data orders.",
