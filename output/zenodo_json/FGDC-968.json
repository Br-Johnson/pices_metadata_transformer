    "description": "The rates of energy flux out of newly formed circular patches of dense water (chimneys) are considered as a function of patch size on an f\nplane. The dense fluid resulting from a rapid deep convective process serves as a powerful reservoir of both mass and energy. Energy flux\ndue to superinertial waves precedes mass flux. Both mass and energy are ultimately carried away from the local site of convection through\nbaroclinic instability. Analytical and numerical methods are employed to investigate the relative amounts of potential energy radiated to the\nfar field by either process, and the rates at which this is accomplished. An analytical solution is developed for the superinertial transients\ngenerated during linear, axisymmetric gravitational adjustment of a unit step. Initial energy decay by axisymmetric gravitational collapse is\ngreater for a narrow chimney than for a wide one, but ultimately this is equaled and surpassed by the steady spreading of the wide chimney\nvia its baroclinic breakup into smaller structures.",
