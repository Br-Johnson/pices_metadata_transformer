    "description": "Scientists for years have been trying to learn why populations of Alaska's Steller sea lions are crashing in western parts of the state. Near the small fishing town of Kodiak, scientists are teaming up to study the ecosystem that supports sea lions. Doug Schneider has more, in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio.",

    "notes": "Purpose: Local fishing boat captain Dave Kubiak eases his 44-foot boat, the Mythos, into the calm waters of the lee side of Cape Chiniak. Here, a cluster of rocky outcroppings serve as a Steller sea lion haul-out, a few miles from the fishing community of Kodiak, on Alaska's Kodiak Island.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: None\n\nUse constraints: None\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
