    "description": "Data Type: Coastline;  This coastline coverage was extracted from an image processing system that uses the digital chart of the world coastline for georeferencing satellite images. The data have a scale of 1:1000000. The vectors pertaining to the greater Arctic Refuge and portions of Canada were extracted, rebuilt with line topology and projected into Albers Conic Equal Area projection.",
