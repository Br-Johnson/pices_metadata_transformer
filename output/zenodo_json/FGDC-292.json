    "description": "Warm and salinity waters enter the northern part of the pacific Subarctic gyre from the south as part of the warm-to-cold water transformation process.  Along this pathway the water column progressively cooled and freshened in marginal seas.  Stratification in the Pacific western Subarctic is maintained not only by the excessive precipitation, but also by the presence of this warm saline intermediate layer.  This prominent mesothermal layer is associated with the halocline.  The vertical profiles of salinity in the Kamchatka Current have a very sharp halocline at 100-200 m depth.  The halocline off the southern Kuril Islands is much weaker and salinity decrease much more gradually.\n\nI show the cooling and freshening of the western Subarctic upper layer which occurred in the western Subarctic during 1988-1998.  The main consequences of this thermohaline transition were westward shift of the Oyashio path, significant changes in the mid layers (200-1000 dbar) and restratification in the Subarctic waters.  The influx of warm subtropical waters far northward to the Oyashio area and weak coastal Oyashio observed before this transition.  This influx appears to have retreated in the early 1990s.  Now mesothermal waters from the north penetrated southward and created strong stratification in the Oyashio area.  This transition is associated with the reinforcement of the coastal Oyashio.\n\nThese observations show that there was significant variability of the Oyashio and Kamchatka currents structure and their fresh-core eddies.  Lateral scale of these eddies, as well as their depth of penetration, decreased, while salinity and destiny increased at mid and deep levels.",
