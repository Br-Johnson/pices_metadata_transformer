    "description": "Zooplankton were collected from 1951 until 1978 by oblique net tows (1 m diameter, 5 m long, 500 um mesh-size nets).  After 1978 a Bongo net, consisting of two side by side 0.71 m diameter 505 um mesh nets, was used.  From 1951 until 1969 tows were made between the surface and a depth of 140 m.  After 1969 tows were made between the surface and a depth of 210 m.  Fish eggs were enumerated from the zooplankton tows. These procedures are summarized in greater detail in Kramer et al. (1972).\n\n   [ Reference : Kramer, D., M. J. Kalin, E. G. Stevens, J. R. Thraikill, J. R. Zweifel, 1972, Collecting and processing data on fish eggs and larvae in the California Current region.
