    "description": "A dissected terrain resembling a shelf-edge canyon system with individual canyons up to 100 m in relief, 3 km in width, and 10 km in length is found along the south\nflank of the Cascadia Channel within the central Blanco Transform zone. The channels apparently formed from a combination of downcutting from turbidity currents\noff the Blanco Ridge and from backcutting due to mass-wasting. The relationships between the transform tectonics and the formation of the canyon are presented in\na model which proposes both a direct link via triggering of slides from earthquakes and an indirect link associated with lowering the local base level of Cascadia\nChannel, thalweg downcutting, and wall-steepening leading to increased mass-wasting.",
