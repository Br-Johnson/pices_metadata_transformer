    "description": "Data from 35,700 hydrographic stations were grouped in area of 1 latitude and 2 longitude and monthly, seasonal and annual means calculated. We examined temperature salinity and water masses of the Bering Sea, studying their vertical structure, temporal variability and features of their spatial and temporal distribution. We also considered data from coastal observations, information on the meteorological regime and river outflow.",
