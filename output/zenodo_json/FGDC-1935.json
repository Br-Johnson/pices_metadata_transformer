    "description": "The joint BASS/MODEL workshop focused on two ECOPATH equilibrium models describing energy flow through the eastern and western subarctic gyres, and explored the dynamics of energy flow in these two systems using ECOPATH/ECOSIM formulations.  \n\nThe MONITOR workshop was focused on reviewing the need and capability of sustained, long-term monitoring of ocean and ecosystem conditions in the PICES region, especially considering the recent emphasis within PICES on producing a North Pacific Ecosystem Status Report. Presentations at the workshop summarized some of the tools that are available now or could be put into place to assist this\neffort - including both regional networks of coastal observing systems, Continuous Plankton Recording (CPR) across the gyres, and data management.  \n\nThe REX workshop summarized historical datasets on salmon and herring populations across the Pacific, with additional contributions on a few other species.\n\nThe fourth report is the result of a joint MODEL/REX workshop that brought scientists involved in developing the NEMURO model together with experts on saury and herring growth. The principal objective was to include a fish growth model into the lower trophic level NEMURO model.\n\n\n    [ LC Call No. GC781 .P535 no.20.  ISBN 0973149205 ]",
