    "description": "This report references habitat utilization and species composition data of algal species: Alaria spp., Fucus spp., and Laminaria spp.; black oystercatchers (Haematopus bachmani); fish species: Anoplarchus purpurescans, Hexagrammos spp., and Pholis laeta; goldeneyes (Bucephala islandica); harlequin ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus); invertebrate communities; invertebrate species: Clinocardium spp., Littorina spp., Lottia spp., Macoma spp., Modiolus spp., Mya spp., Siliqua spp., Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis, Tectura spp., and Telmessus cheiragonus; nearshore bird and fish communities; and scoters (Melanitta spp.) and habitat utilization data of sea otters (Enhydra lutris) from Prince William Sound, Alaska.\n\n  The aforementioned data are referenced in citation: Foster, N.R. and H.M. Feder.  2000.  Biodiversity of Prince William Sound.  Chapter 10.  In Hines, A.H. and G.M. Ruiz (eds.), Biological invasions of cold-water coastal ecosystems: ballast-mediated introductions in Port Valdez/Prince William Sound, Final Report to Citizen's Advisory Council of Prince William Sound, Alaska, 18 pp.\n\n  This literature was collected as part of a metadatabase that represents one or more nearshore resources (from physical attributes such as water and air, to birds and mammals).  Each entry is viewable in three formats, 1) a geospatial explicit format (ArcView 3.3) named GIS ArcView 3.3 Near GEM project, 2) a spreadsheet format (Excel 2002 and within ArcView) named GEM Nearshore Metadata Set, and 3) a ProCite database named GEM Nearshore Metadata References, which consists of references included in 1 and 2 above.  The ProCite database record number corresponds to the Excel Procite Number.  Reference Procite #1137 for this literature's metadata.\n\n  The metadata are maintained in digital format (ArcView 3.3, Excel 2002, and Procite) and are available from the Alaska Science Center, USGS in Anchorage, Alaska.\n\n  For a detailed description of the three databases and the project, see \"Bodkin, J. L., and T. Dean.  2003.
