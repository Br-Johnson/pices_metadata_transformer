    "description": "Traveling and recreating in Alaskaﾒs backcountry used to be enjoyed only by the experienced mountaineer and skier. These days, thanks to improved equipment, just\nabout anyone can get themselves high into the stateﾒs snow-covered mountains. And thatﾒs the problem. As Doug Schneider reports in this weekﾒs Arctic Science Journeys Radio, the backcountry can be a beautiful but deadly place.",

Fredston is an avalanche specialist and codirector of the Alaska Mountain Safety Center, based in Anchorage. She says more people are getting into trouble in the backcountry.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required.\n\nUse constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
