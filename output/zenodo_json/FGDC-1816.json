    "description": "While the Eastern Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska model may capture broad-scale dynamics of widespread fish stocks, their scale is too large to address local depletion.  This may be an important issue for island-based fish such as Atka mackerel, and may be critical for determining the effect that changes in the food web may have on the endangered Steller sea lion.  This smaller-scale ECOPATH model will be used in conjunction with larger-scale models to examine the possibility of linking the models across scales.  \n\n[ Reference: PICES Scientific Report No. 18 2001, Proceedings of the PICES/CoML/IPRC Workshop on \"Impact of Climate Variability on Observation and Prediction of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes in the North Pacific\", http://www.pices.int/publications/scientific_reports/Report18/default.aspx. ]",
