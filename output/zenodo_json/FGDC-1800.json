    "description": "The Continuous Plankton Recorder is towed on a transect from Alaska to California (until 2004) or to Puget Sound (from 2004). The transect is sampled between 5 and 7 times per year. The transect is divided up into discrete plankton samples, each 18kms long. Every fourth collected sample (and every sequential Alaskan shelf sample) is processed for hard-shelled phytoplankton and mesozooplankton (principally crustacea). Organisms are identified to the highest practicable taxonomic level and levels of abundance are recorded for each taxon. All samples are archived. The data are stored as counts of each taxon together with time, date and location of collection of the mid-point of the sample. \n\nPlease also see Metadata ID 2015 for another north Pacific CPR project.  \n\n[ An EVOS GEM project ]",
