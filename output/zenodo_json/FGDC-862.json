    "description": "Data Type: Vegetation/Land Cover/Soils;  The Alaska Biological Conservation Database (BCD) is part of a standardized network among all fifty states, five Canadian Provinces, and eleven countries that provide information on population numbers, distribution, geography, ecology, rarity ranking and protection status for rare and sensitive plant and animal species, plant communities, and critical habitats. This database is a relational database management system application that contains many linked databases of which three are separate databases with a spatial component. These databases are the element occurrence database, the site database and the managed area database. Of these three data sets only the Element occurrence database has been automated in ARC/INFO GIS format to date.",
