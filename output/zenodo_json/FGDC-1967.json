    "description": "Scientists have for years been trying to unravel the causes of the decline in the number of Steller sea lions roaming Alaska's coast. Thus far they've been largely unsuccessful. As Doug Schneider reports in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio, scientists say capturing and studying juvenile sea lions may be the species' best hope for survival.",

    "notes": "Purpose: Ever since the 1960s, the number of Steller sea lions living along the remote and rocky coast of Alaska has been in a kind of free-fall. By some estimates the total populationﾗbelieved to have once numbered in the hundreds of thousandsﾗhas plummeted some 80 percent. In most of Alaska, the species is now considered in danger of extinction. Scientists themselves are frustrated that after so much research, they're still no closer to understanding the causes of the decline, or how to help the species recover.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: None\n\nUse constraints: None\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
