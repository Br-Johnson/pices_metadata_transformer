    "description": "Scientists for years have predicted that as the Arctic climate warms, sea ice, glaciers and permafrost will melt, sea levels will rise, and the tree line will move north. As Doug\nSchneider reports in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio, their predictions are coming true, and the changes they'll bring will have a profound effect on Alaska's people and environment.",

    "notes": "Purpose: This past winter, Kotzebue Sound, a narrow span of ocean in northwest Alaska, remained ice-free through much of the winter. Caleb Pungowiyi, a native elder and hunter from the nearby village of Kotzebue, thinks that had something to do with the lack of ringed seal pups in the sound this spring.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required.\n\nUse constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
