    "description": "Beginning at 0700 GMT on 28 February 1996, intense seismicity was detected in the northeast Pacific Ocean using the T-phase Monitoring System developed by\nNOAA/PMEL to access the U.S. Navyﾒs SOund SUrveillance System (SOSUS) in the North Pacific. The event was preliminarily located on the northernmost\nsegment of the Gorda Ridge near 42.67°N and 126.8°W, in the vicinity of the ridge segment high (\"narrowgate\"). The nature of the seismicity was similar to that\nobserved in June 1993 at the CoAxial segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge, which was later documented to be a lateral magma injection with subsequent eruption.\nDue to several gaps in the data, the detection information was not as comprehensive as during the CoAxial event, but an initial migration of epicenters from the\nnarrowgate area down-rift is inferred based on arrival bearings from a single array; there is evidence for an additional diking event on the second and third day of\nactivity. There is also indication of a concentration of epicenters located near 42.6°N, as occurred during the CoAxial episode at what was later determined to be an\neruption site. Examination of T-wave rise times generally supports this interpretation. Based on the nature and duration of the activity, a response effort was initiated,\nwhich later confirmed hot-water plumes and fresh lava flows at the site. Based on both hydroacoustic information and field observations, it is proposed that the\nepisode began with a lateral dike injection, possibly with eruptive activity in the summit region, followed by multiple magma pulses and eventual focusing of the\nseismic activity and extrusion near 42.6°N.",
