    "description": "Scientists learn a lot about animals, birds and fish by peering into their stomachs to see what they eat. A new study on how walrus digest their food has scientists rethinking this\nmarine mammal's impact on the ocean food chain. Doug Schneider has more in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio.",

    "notes": "Purpose: Biologists have long known that walrus comb the bottom of the sea, rooting out clams, snails, worms and other creatures from the seabed. But when they've had occasion to\nexamine the inside of a walrus stomach such as after they've been harvested by Native hunters what they usually find are just the leftover, hard-to-digest pieces of clams. That's led scientists to presume that walrus ate far more clams than anything else.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required.\n\nUse constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
