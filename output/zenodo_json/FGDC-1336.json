    "description": "The Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set or COADS* is an extensive oceanographic and meteorological dataset. COADS is the result of a continuing cooperative project between the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) - its Environmental Research Laboratories (ERL), National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), and Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES; joint with the University of Colorado) - and the National Science Foundation's National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).\n\nThe COADS data can be accessed in two ways. The CEOS Project reorganized the CMR.5 version of COADS and stored all of it by area on CD-ROM. CEOS also developed the CODE program to quickly access, process, and summarize the stored data. CODE provides the means, variances, and number of observations for selected parameters from a specified ocean region within a chosen time period. The program creates an output file that can be easily imported into spreadsheet and graphics applications for additional editing, analysis, and display.\n\n[ Reference: PICES Scientific Report No. 18 2001, Proceedings of the PICES/CoML/IPRC Workshop on \"Impact of Climate Variability on Observation and Prediction of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes in the North Pacific\", http://www.pices.int/publications/scientific_reports/Report18/default.aspx. ]",
