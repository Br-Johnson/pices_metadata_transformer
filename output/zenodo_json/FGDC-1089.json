    "description": "Lava flows erupted during the January/February 1998 seismic swarm at Axial Volcano on the Juan de Fuca Ridge have been identified by differencing of pre- and\npost-event multibeam bathymetric surveys and by seafloor observations. A sheet flow more than 3 km in length and 500-800 m wide erupted from the uppermost\nsouth rift is the site of a robust hydrothermal system. 1998 lavas occur over about 9 km of the upper south rift zone, or about 20% of the along-axis length of the\nseismicity event (~50 km). The estimated volume of laval erupted is 18-76 ￗ 10 m for the extrusion and 100-150 ￗ 10 m for the intrusion. The total volume is\nconsistent with the volume from modeling of seafloor strain measurements recorded during the event.",
