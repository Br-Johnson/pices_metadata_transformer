    "description": "Data Type: Ocean/Coasts ;   Topographic maps of the sea floor. Through the use of detailed depth contours and full use of bathymetric data, the size, shape and distribution of underwater features are vividly portrayed. Scale for all Prince William Sound maps is 1:250,000. The regional map for the Gulf of Alaska (an incomplete blueprint) includes Glacier Bay and is at a scale of 1:1,000,000.",
