    "description": "Northward inflows of the Alaskan Stream through Near Strait, Amchitka Pass and Amukta Pass help produce eastward flow along the northern side of the Aleutian Islands.  We call this feature the Aleutian North Slope Current (ANSC).  The  ANSC is often fairly narrow and shallow with peak speeds sometimes >40 cm/s.  Eddylike features also occur in this region.  At times, an eastward velocity maximum is present below the near-surface ANSC; this appears to result from the structure of flow in Amchitka Pass.  The ANSC transports 2-4 x 10 (to the 6th) m (to the 3rd)/s. and is the main source of the northwestward flowing Bering Slope Current, which in turn provides inflow to the Kamchatka Current on the western side of the Bering Sea basin.",
