    "description": "Approximately 2,382 line km of 24-channel seismic-reflection\nprofiles are now available from the western Gulf of Alaska.  The\nprofiles were collected during the summer of 1977 on the U.S.\nGeological Survey (USGS) Research Vessel S.P. LEE using a sound\nsource of five airguns with a volume of 1,326 cu. in. of air\ncompressed to approximately 1,900 psi.  The recording system\nconsisted of a 24-group streamer, 2,400 m long and a GUS (Global\nUniversal Science) model 4200 recording instrument.  Shots were\nfired every 50 m and the group interval was 100 m.  A 2-msec\nsampling rate was used in the field and the data were later\ndesampled to 4 msec during the demultiplexing process.\nNavigational control for the survey was by a Marconi integrated\nsatellite/Doppler sonar navigation system.  Record lengths vary\nfrom 7 to 13 sec, depending on water depth with 6- to 7-sec\nrecorded penetration below the seafloor.  The U.S. Geological\nSurvey, Dept. of Interior, has provided these data to NGDC for\npublic dissemination.",
