    "description": "Plankton have been sampled yearly in Auke Bay since the 1970s as an index of environmental conditions for salmon fry.  The Auke Bay Monitor station (ABM) is sampled weekly from March or April until fry have left the nearshore habitat in June, then monthly, until October each year.  Three replicate samples of the upper water column are collected with a 20-m vertical tow using a 0.5 m diameter, 243 Fm mesh Norpac net.  Settled volumes are measured immediately in the laboratory, then samples are preserved for detailed microscopic analysis of species, stage and size composition and enumeration.  A long-term database is maintained for interannual comparisons.",
