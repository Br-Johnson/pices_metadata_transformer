    "description": "It is known, that macrophytes are capable to accumulate polluting substances, especially heavy metals.  Laminaria japonica, as widely used in a food and pharmaceutical industry and forming kelp were over along coast northern Primorye, is chosen for an estimation of influence of pollution on morphology, anatomy and reproduction.  The research was carried out along coast northern Primorye, including area of chronic pollution of waters by heavy metals (Rudnaya Bay, Japan Sea, Christophorova, 1989) during a number of years.",
