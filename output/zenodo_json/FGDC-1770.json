    "description": "Consists of satellite measurements of global and regional ocean color data obtained by the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor, in orbit on the OrbView-2 (formerly SeaStar) platform. The concentration and predominant identity of substances and particles in the euphotic (lighted) zone of the upper ocean influences the apparent color of the ocean, which can range from deep blue to varying shades of green and ruddy brown. Living phytoplankton (which contain chlorophyll and associated photosynthetic pigments), inorganic sediments, detritus (particulate organic matter), and dissolved organic matter all contribute to the color of the ocean. The data are primarily intended for used by marine researchers.  All SeaWiFS data files are in Hierarchical Data Format (HDF).  \n\n[ Reference: PICES Scientific Report No. 18 2001, Proceedings of the PICES/CoML/IPRC Workshop on \"Impact of Climate Variability on Observation and Prediction of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes in the North Pacific\", http://www.pices.int/publications/scientific_reports/Report18/default.aspx. ]",
