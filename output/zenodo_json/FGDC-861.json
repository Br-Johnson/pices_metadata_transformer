    "description": "Data Type: Remotely Sensed Data;   A TM instrument is flown on Landsat 4 and 5, the last two of the five Landsats. Both satellite's TM radiometers acquire day and night data which are systematically corrected during processing. The standard digital data product is in a band sequential (BSQ) FAST format. Landsat 4 and 5's TM mechanical scanning radiometers operate in 7 channels of the electromagnetic spectrum (band 1 spectral range is .45-.52 micometers, band 2 is .52-.60, band 3 is .63-.69, band 4 is .76-.90, band 5 is 1.55-1.75, band 6 is 10.40-12.50, and band 7 is 2.08-2.35). Six reflective bands are blue, green, red, and near infrared. Two shortwave infrared bands and a band measuring emitted energy 10.4 to 12.5 micrometers and has 120 meter ground resolution. Landsat 4 was launched 7/16/82 with Landsat 5 following on 3/1/84. Paths 57-68 and Rows 17-20 cover Prince William Sound Copper River Region and Glacier Bay Ecosystem Initiative Areas.",
