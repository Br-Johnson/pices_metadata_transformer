    "description": "Data from two conductivity/temperature/depth (CTD) casts at the same site are presented. The first cast had two distinct excursions in\nsalinity, and spuriously low salinity throughout the cast, while the second had valid data. We suspect that the spurious salinity resulted from\ntransient biological fouling of the conductivity cell.",
