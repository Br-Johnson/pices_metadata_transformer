    "description": "The Coastal Pelagic Fishes Working Group evaluated how long term global changes in climate affect the pelagic fishes of the North Pacific.  Pelagic fishes considered by the Working Group included: Pacific herring, sardines, anchovies, saury, jack mackerel, and Pacific mackerel.  The Working Group proposed to use comparative methods to determine how long-term effects of climate may affect the dynamics of these North Pacific stocks.\n\nThe Subarctic Gyre Working Group identified and reviewed key scientific questions on the physical fluctuations of the Subarctic Gyre in the North Pacific.\n\n\n[ LC Call No. GC781 .P535 no.1.
