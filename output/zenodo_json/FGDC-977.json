    "description": "A local, two-dimensional principal-component analysis has been applied to mesoscale winds in a region strongly influenced by\ntopography. The principal components successfully separate axial winds over Puget Sound from cross-axial winds. Energy spectra of\nwinter axial winds contain significant peaks at synoptic-scale periods of 1.5-5 days but also a strong peak of unknown origin at 17 days.\nCross-axial winds are dominated by the land-sea breeze. Day-night asymmetries in the land-sea temperature contrast lead to diurnal\nmodulation and energy at the semidiurnal period. The land breeze persists in winter over Puget Sound, but the sea breeze dominates a\nweakened land breeze in summer.",
