    "description": "In response to the 1996 magmatic intrusion on the Gorda Ridge near 42.68°N, 126.78°W in late February, we conducted three cruises to the region in March,\nApril, and June. On all three cruises particulate samples were collected, along with CTD/nephelometer data and total dissolved Fe and Mn samples. During each\ncruise, we collected samples from large oblate spheroid-shaped event plumes. These event plumes had long axis diameters of about 10-15 km and ranged in depth\nfrom about 1800 m to 2700 m. A strong linear correlation between nephelometer voltage and particulate Fe allowed us to estimate the total amount of particulate Fe\nin the event plumes at approximately 21 ￗ 10 moles of Fe, or ~28% of the Fe in the 1986 megaplume on the Cleft Segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge. We\nobserved significant decreases in particulate Cu and Zn concentrations (>100% decrease in Cu/Fe and Zn/Fe ratios) between the Gorda Ridge event plumes. These\nresults suggest that each of the two event plumes originated from a chemically distinct source fluid. Fe ferrihydrite particles maintained a constant ratio of\ncoprecipitated oxyanion species in the two event plumes. Based upon the chemical inventories for particulate Fe, P, and V, we suggest that event plumes might play\na small role in the geochemical budgets for these elements.",
