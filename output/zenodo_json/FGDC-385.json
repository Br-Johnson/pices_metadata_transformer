    "description": "A classical view of April-August stratification on the Bering Sea shelf is an isothermal inner domain, a two-layer middle domain and a three-layer outer domain: domain boundaries are roughly 50 and 100 m.  Based on a data set from 1974 to 1997, we show considerable spatial, intra-seasonal and interannual variability in this picture.  The primary physical balance is between solar heating and turbulent mixing by tidal currents and wind.",
