    "description": "An  inter-disciplinary study was conducted from 1986 to 1992 in the Beaufort Shelf/Mackenzie Delta to measure the transport and fate of hydrocarbons over the Beaufort Shelf (Beaufort Sea and Mackenzie River Delta )and the primary productivity of these coastal waters. Physical, chemical and biological oceanographic data was also collected and hydrocarbon concentrations were determined in suspended particulate, sediments and shoreline peat.",
