    "description": "This data set contains total column aerosol optical thickness gridpoint values calculated from channel 2 albedo observations (using the SST cloud clearing algorithm). The analyzed weekly fields are at 100km resolution.  \n\n  \nThe Office of Satellite Data Processing and Distribution (OSDPC) keeps this data for a month, then sends it to the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) for archiving.
