    "description": "Bays and semi-enclosed seas provide a natural spatial scale at which to characterize the trophic organization of marine communities. This article summarizes the information available on the trophic organization (species number, relative abundance, seasonal abundance, foraging style, and diet) of the marine bird community at the spatial scale of the entire Bering Sea. This required synthesizing work in English (pertaining to the east) and Russian (pertaining to the west), much of it published after 1980. A total of 51 seabird species (not counting loons, grebes, and seaducks) regularly inhabit the Bering Sea. Based on work available (to 1990), the minimum number of breeding seabirds in the western Bering Sea is 3.1 x 10 super(6) along the Asian coast (Cape Kamchatskiy to the Bering Strait), 10 super(6) in the\n Commander Islands, 1.1 x 10 super(7) in the Aleutian Islands, and 1.2 x 10 super(7) along the North American coast (Unimak Pass to the Bering Strait). Nonbreeding seabirds include 3 species of albatross, 3 pagophilic gulls, and on the order of 3.3 x 10 super(7) Puffinus shearwaters. Seasonal movements are primarily meridional (north-south) and strongly tied to the breeding cycle. Major foraging styles include surface gleaning (as in fulmars), bottom gleaning (as in cormorants), and mid-water pursuit (as in murres). Major prey resources include euphausiids, squid, immature fish (notably Walleye Pollock), and copepods. The data show that less than five avian species account for most of the energy flux to the avian community. The data indicate that this flux is strongly seasonal and highly localized in space. Localized seasonal concentrations of invertebrates (notably euphausiids and copepods) appear to be more important sources of energy flux to birds in this ecosystem than at lower latitudes.",
