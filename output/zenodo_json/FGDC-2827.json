    "description": "The paper presents the first illustrated description of cases when ascidians\n     were observed on pointed cheliped digits of the crabs Chionoecetes bairdi\n     and C. opilio. This phenomenon was most often observed in the eastern\n     Olutorsk Bay and the western Bering Sea. The digits entered the ascidian\n     bodies through their siphon openings. C. bairdi with ascidians accounted for\n     about 0.25% of the crabs caught by commercial crab pots whereas C. opilio\n     with ascidians occurred much more rarely, which may be due to the fact that\n     the digits in the former are more curved than in the latter.",
