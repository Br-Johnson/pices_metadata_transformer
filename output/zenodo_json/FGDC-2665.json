    "description": "Details are given of the use of virtual population analysis to estimate the stocks\n     of the West Bering Sea Pollock (Theragra chalcogramma). Data regarding\n     year class abundance for the years 1966-84 and recruitment from 1973-88\n     are presented. The total abundance of the Pollock population was found to be\n     the main influence on the strength of the year class; environmental factors have\n     little effect on the abundance of year classes, although more favorable\n     reproductive conditions are found in years with warmer water temperature.\n     Recruitment to the fishery occurs primarily at ages 2-4 and varies from 0.9 to\n     5.9 million fish; on average the ratio of recruits of the rest of the stock is 1:1.",
