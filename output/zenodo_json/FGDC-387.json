    "description": "This uses data from two surveys in 1991 and 1992 to examine hydrography on the shelf of the western part of the Bering Sea.  The shelf waters are divided into coastal, transitional and oceanic zones.  The borders of the oceanographic regions are not stationary but vary in relation to position of the Kamchatka Current.  When the Kamchatka Current is far from the continental slope, there are only two regions on the shelf (coastal and transitional) and the oceanic zone is displayed beyond the shelf.\n\n Winter conditions greatly affect water properties in summer.  After a harsh winter, relatively cold water appears in summer, conversely, a mild winter precedes a summer with warm water.",
