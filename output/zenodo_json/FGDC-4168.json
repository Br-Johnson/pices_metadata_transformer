    "description": "Data collected by DFO to monitor the effects on Rupert and Holdberg Inlets of Island Copper Mines, located off Rupert Inlet. There is, in addition to this data set, a very large body of data collected from 1975 to 1997 by Island Copper Mines as part of their licence to discharge about 40,000 T of tailings per day into Rupert Inlet.  This included oceanographic and biological data in a custom, commercial software format (AQUAMIN). The data set was offered to IOS before the mine closed, but was not obtained.  It may be entirely lost or unretrievable, but represents valuable data and is worth pursuing.",
