    "description": "It is assumed the yellowfin tuna can be recruited to the fishable population during every quarter of the year.  Therefore, there are four estimates of recruitment for each year.  Estimates of recruitment of yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares)  are scaled so that average recruitment is equal to 1.0, which is 39,257,074 fish per quarter.  The most-recent stock assessment of yellowfin makes no strong assumptions about the relationship between adult biomass (or abundance) and recruitment.  The recruitment of yellowfin tuna to the fisheries in the eastern Pacific Ocean is variable, and appears to be related to sea-surface temperatures (SSTs).   \n\n[ Reference: PICES Scientific Report No. 18 2001, Proceedings of the PICES/CoML/IPRC Workshop on \"Impact of Climate Variability on Observation and Prediction of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes in the North Pacific\", http://www.pices.int/publications/scientific_reports/Report18/default.aspx. ]",
