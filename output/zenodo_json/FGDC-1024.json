    "description": "The episodic magmatic intrusions that accompany seafloor spreading can profoundly affect the discharge of hydrothermal heat and fluid. A rapid field response to the acoustic detection of seismic activity on the CoAxial segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge, June/July 1993, provided the opportunity to conduct a unique series of observations of hydrothermal event plumes. Between July 3 and 26 we detected at least three event plumes ranging in plume volume from 1.3 to 4 ￗ 10 m, and in excess heat from 2.2 to 12.4 ￗ 10 J. Two were discovered directly above a new lava extrusion. One of these was first sampled within days of its release, as evidenced by its asymmetric shape, complex structure, and a steadily increasing light attenuation anomaly apparently generated by ongoing precipitation of hydrothermal Fe. We hypothesize that event plumes were produced intermittently in response to successive volcano-tectonic events that produced pulses in seismic activity between June 28 and July 14.",
