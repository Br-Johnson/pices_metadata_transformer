    "description": "The Bering Sea is a region of extreme seasonal as well as substantial interannual variability in its air-ice-ocean environment.  This chapter updates work on the weather/climate and ice environment of the Bering Sea and its surrounding environs.  Topics with extra emphasis include polynyas, analyses of ~ 50 years long time series of the air-ice-ocean parameters, analysis of a climate \"regime shift\" and the connection of the Bering Sea environment with interannual variability in the Aleutian Low (i.e. indices of interannual atmospheric variation such as the North Pacific (NP) and western Pacific (WP) oscillation in the North Pacific as well as the Southern Oscillation index (SOI) in the tropical Pacific.",
