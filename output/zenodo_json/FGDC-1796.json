    "description": "Long-term variations of plankton biomass in the eastern, central Pacific, and eastern Bering Sea were estimated using data published by the University of Hokkaido.  Three data sets were used to analyze long-term variations of plankton biomass in the Oyashio water: data collected by the Tohoku National Fisheries Research Institute; data set by the Hakodate Marine Observatory; and data downloaded from the JODC website.  Data include temperature, salinity, zooplankton, diatom cell, chlorophyll-a, PO4, NO3, and SIO4.\n\n[ Reference: PICES Scientific Report No. 18 2001, Proceedings of the PICES/CoML/IPRC Workshop on \"Impact of Climate Variability on Observation and Prediction of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes in the North Pacific\", http://www.pices.int/publications/scientific_reports/Report18/default.aspx. ]",
