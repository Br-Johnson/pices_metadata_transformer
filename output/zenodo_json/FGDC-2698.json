S. and allied nations, the Departments of Commerce and\nTransportation, and other U. S. Government and international agencies, and the civil sector. The NIC produces these analyses and forecasts of Arctic, Antarctic, Great Lakes and Chesapeake Bay ice conditions to support customers with global, regional and tactical scale interests. The NIC regularly deploys NAVICECEN Ice Reconnaissance personnel to the Arctic and Antarctica in order to perform aerial ice observation and analysis in support of NIC customers. NIC ice data are a key part of the U. S. contribution to international global climate and ocean observing systems.",
