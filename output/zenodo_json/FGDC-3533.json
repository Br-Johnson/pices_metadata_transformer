    "description": "This report references geographic distribution, population abundance, production, and species composition data of algal species: Alaria spp. and Fucus spp.; fish species (Ammodytes hexapterus); invertebrate communities; and invertebrate species: Clinocardium spp., Evasterias troschelii, Littorina spp., Macoma spp., Modiolus modiolus, Mytilus trossulus, Protothaca staminea, Siliqua patula, Spisula polynyma, Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis, and Telmessus cheiragonus and shoreline geomorphological type data of sediment from Kodiak Island, Alaska.\n\n  The aforementioned data are referenced in citation: Zimmerman, S. T., J. L. Hanson, J. T. Fujioka, N. I. Calvin, J. A. Gharrett, and J. S. MacKinnon.  1978.  Intertidal biota and subtidal kelp communities of the Kodiak Island area. In Environmental Assessment of the Alaskan Continental Shelf, Final Reports of Principal Investigators, Volume 4: Biological Studies, NOAA RU# 78.  316-508 pp.\n\n  This literature was collected as part of a metadatabase that represents one or more nearshore resources (from physical attributes such as water and air, to birds and mammals).  Each entry is viewable in three formats, 1) a geospatial explicit format (ArcView 3.3) named GIS ArcView 3.3 Near GEM project, 2) a spreadsheet format (Excel 2002 and within ArcView) named GEM Nearshore Metadata Set, and 3) a ProCite database named GEM Nearshore Metadata References, which consists of references included in 1 and 2 above.  The ProCite database record number corresponds to the Excel Procite Number.  Reference Procite #1073 for this literature's metadata.\n\n  The metadata are maintained in digital format (ArcView 3.3, Excel 2002, and Procite) and are available from the Alaska Science Center, USGS in Anchorage, Alaska.\n\n  For a detailed description of the three databases and the project, see \"Bodkin, J. L., and T. Dean.  2003.
