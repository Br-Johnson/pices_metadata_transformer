    "description": "This project addresses the need to integrate top trophic-level predators into interdisciplinary mesoscale and fine-scale process studies of middle trophic levels in the southeast Bering Sea. In collaboration with physical, chemical and biological sampling within the Fisheries-Oceanography Coordinated Investigations (FOCI) and the Midwater Assessment and Conservation Engineering Program (MACE), our survey will provide data to define trophic linkages between middle and upper trophic levels, specifically cetaceans, contributing to effects on community structure and function. Results will define top-down and bottom-up interactions, especially in regard to euphausiids\n(Thysanoessa inermis and T. raschii) and copepods (e.g., Neocalanus cristatus, Neocalanus plumchrus, and Calanus marshallae) which are important forage for upper trophic level predators. Information on the spatial distributions of whales, and estimates of feeding rates, relative to interannual variability in the productivity and physical forcing in the system, will be used to estimate rates of energy transfer upward from middle trophic levels. Models of trophic interactions and carbon flow within the systems will greatly benefit from these data. Predation may also be a factor that explains swarming and schooling of zooplankton and fish, thus further explaining discontinuities of prey distributions. Finally, in addition to the mesoscale survey, we will focus specific sampling and foraging aggregations of whales, which act as natural integrative plankton recorders. Our survey defines mesoscale variability in zooplankton biomass across the shelf from the shelf-edge to the Inner Front. From the bottom-up perspective, we propose to test the hypothesis that physical processes and variation in prey density do not affect the occurrence patterns of top trophic level predators in the southeast Bering Sea shelf; or that there is no threshold of prey density that can just be reached before the distribution of predators is affected. Alternately, from the top-down perspective,\nwe hypothesize that average swarm/school characteristics, as assessed by acoustic and net sampling (i.e. size, depth, density, shape), remain the same regardless of densities and behavior of predators in the vicinity.    \n\n[ An NPMR project ]  [ Reference: Tynan, C.T. 2004.
