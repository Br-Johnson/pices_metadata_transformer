    "description": "Seafloor hydrothermal systems are profoundly altered by magmatic fluctuations, which are inherently episodic and generally unpredictable.\nAt present, three examples of hydrothermal systems perturbed by magmatic intrusion have been identified and sampled: 1986 on the Cleft\nsegment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge; 1991 at 10Â°N on the East Pacific Rise; and 1993 on the CoAxial segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge.\nFrom the fragmentary observations at each site three trends can be identified that may be common to magmatically perturbed\nhydrothermal systems. The flux of heat and mass can increase by orders of magnitude virtually simultaneously with a magmatic intrusion by\nthe sudden and short-lived release of event plumes, while chronic discharge remains elevated for months or years afterwards. Vent fluid\ncomposition is altered by at least two processes. Phase separation is initiated or enhanced, producing fluids highly enriched in the vapour\nphase. The conjugate brine-enriched fluid may be stored in the crust to be flushed months or years later by convecting seawater.\nMagmatic degassing increases the flux of volatiles, temporarily elevating He/temperature ratios. Time series observations of magmatically\naltered vent fields are vital, because chemical budget extrapolations and hypotheses derived only from observations of stable hydrothermal\ndischarge may be incomplete or unreliable.",
