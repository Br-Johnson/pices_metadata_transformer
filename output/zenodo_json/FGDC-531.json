    "description": "This project will adapt a technique for assessing diets of marine mammals using fatty acid signatures to study seabirds in the southeastern Bering Sea. An NPMR project titled \"Estimating seabird diets using fatty acids: Protocol development and testing of ReFER Hypotheses\",  the method has numerous advantages over other more common approaches that use ratios of stable isotopes and stomach content analyses. It will test hypotheses presented in the ReFER (Regime Forcing and Ecosystem Response) conceptual model that diets of populations of nonspecific seabirds differ between oceanic and shelf habitats and that differences in diet account for opposite trends in abundance at the Pribilof Islands (shelf habitat) compared to Bogoslof Island (oceanic habitat). As part of the study, we will develop an inventory of fatty acid profiles of key forage species in the region that will be useful for diet studies of not only seabirds, but of trophically related marine mammals including sea lions, fur seals, and harbor seals. We will develop a protocol for obtaining biopsy samples of live birds, reducing their mortality rates from diet research.\n\nThis project also includes:\n\nAlan Springer\nUniversity of Alaska, Fairbanks\nP.O.

    "notes": "Purpose: Progress Report (2000) on a proposal (Estimating seabird diets using fatty acids: Protocol development and testing of  ReFER hypotheses) sent to NPMR to record the diets of seabirds (red-legged and blacked-legged kittiwakes) of the Pribilof Islands (shelf habitat) compared to Bogoslof Island (oceanic habitat).   To study forage species (e.g., pollock, lanterfish, squid, euphausiids, sand lance, capelin) and fatty acid signature in the southeastern Bering Sea, that will be of value in similar diet studies of other species of seabirds and marine mammals.\n\nStatus: Planned\n\nMaintenance frequency: Unknown\n\nAccess constraints: Unknown\n\nUse constraints: Unknown\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
