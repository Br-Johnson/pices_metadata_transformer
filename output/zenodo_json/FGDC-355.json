    "description": "The Native village of Mekoryuk wants to share its knowledge of the Bering Sea with the western research community. We also want to increase our capacity to do western style research and therefore participate with other researchers in the North Pacific Marine Research Project.  Our Elders have seen great changes and have a tremendous amount of knowledge that needs to be recorded.  This information will be very useful for other researchers and will be made available to them, provide it is used appropriately.  It has been traditional to make observations about what one sees in the environment and to share these observations with others in the village - this is how we survived.  In today's busy world this communication is not happening as much and observations are going untold and therefore unrecorded in our oral tradition.  This project would reopen sharing about observations and would record them in a western scientific way.\n\nAn NPMR project",
