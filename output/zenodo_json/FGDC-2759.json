    "description": "Results are synthesized from studies of the atmosphere, ice cover, water properties, circulation, and biological-physical interactions for the eastern Bering Sea. Meteorological conditions are dominated by storms. These events govern the formation and advection of ice and provide energy for mixing. Exchange of heat with the atmosphere determines magnitude and extent of colder bottom waters over the middle shelf, and winds generate current pulses. Water over this shelf is partitioned zonally by a system of fronts which separate three hydrographic domains. These domains are distinguishable primarily by depth (Z) and seasonal changes in vertical density structure: coastal (Z <50 m), middle shelf (50 < Z < 100 m) and outer shelf (100 < Z < 170 m). There is also a more subtle north-south temperature difference with decreasing temperatures toward the north. The hydrographic domains are nearly coincident with current regimes and are distinguishable by their distribution of horizontal kinetic energy and mean flow. Although there were great advances in our knowledge of the abiotic environment of this shelf in the past decade, many gaps still remain in both observational coverage and understanding; these are presented for future consideration.",
