    "description": "Ocean color remote sensing data was used to study continuous monitoring temporal and spatial variability of Chl-a concentration.  Temporal and spatial distributions of Chl-a in the northwestern Pacific, northeastern Pacific, Kuroshio region, Japan Sea, and offshore Sanriku, were analyzed.  Ocean color data from November 1996 to June 1997 and August 1997 to 2000 were from the OCTS on ADEOS by NASDA and from SeaWiFS by NASA-DAAC, respectively.  Ship observations were carried out by R/V Mirai, T/S Oshoro-Maru and T/S Hokusei-Maru in the northern North Pacific and the Bering Sea during the same time period.  From June 1998 to May 2000, Station KNOT was visited monthly except for winter season.  To match in situ Chl-a and satellite-estimated Chl-a, ship observations were carried out by other research vessels in adjacent seas around Japan.  Salinity, temperature and depth were measured using a CTD profiler.  \n\n[ Reference: PICES Scientific Report No. 18 2001, Proceedings of the PICES/CoML/IPRC Workshop on \"Impact of Climate Variability on Observation and Prediction of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes in the North Pacific\", http://www.pices.int/publications/scientific_reports/Report18/default.aspx. ]",
