    "description": "This report references oil contaminants, population abundance, species composition, and habitat utilization data of goldeneyes (Bucephala islandica), harlequin ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus), and scoters (Melanitta spp.).  Oil contaminant data in sediment were also collected from Prince William Sound (PWS).\n\n  The aforementioned data are referenced in citation: Agler, B. A., P. E. Seiser, S. J. Kendall and D.B. Irons.  1994.  Marine bird and sea otter populations of Prince William Sound, Alaska: population trends following the Exxon Valdez oil spill.  EVOS Restoration Final Report, Project 93045.  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Migratory Bird Management, Marine and Coastal Bird Project, Anchorage, Alaska.\n\n  This literature was collected as part of a metadatabase that represents one or more nearshore resources (from physical attributes such as water and air, to birds and mammals).  Each entry is viewable in three formats, 1) a geospatial explicit format (ArcView 3.3) named GIS ArcView 3.3 Near GEM project, 2) a spreadsheet format (Excel 2002 and within ArcView) named GEM Nearshore Metadata Set, and 3) a ProCite database named GEM Nearshore Metadata References, which consists of references included in 1 and 2 above.  The ProCite database record number corresponds to the Excel Procite Number.  Reference Procite #8 for this literature's metadata.\n\n  The metadata are maintained in digital format (ArcView 3.3, Excel 2002, and Procite) and are available from the Alaska Science Center, USGS in Anchorage, Alaska.  \n\n  For a detailed description of the three databases and the project, see \"Bodkin, J. L., and T. Dean.  2003.
