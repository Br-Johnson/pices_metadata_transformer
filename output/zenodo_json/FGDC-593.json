    "description": "Data Type: Base Maps;  This data layer consists of all section boundaries within the Prince William Sound - Copper River ecosystem. Pacific GIS derived the section boundaries layer from data obtained from the Alaska Department of Natural Resources (DNR). Additional grid data layers covering the Prince William Sound - Copper River ecosystem include a 1:250,000 scale USGS quadrangle coverage (quad250), a 1:63,360 scale USGS quadrangle coverage (quad63), a township boundary coverage (township), and a latitude and longitude layer (lat_long) coverage.",
