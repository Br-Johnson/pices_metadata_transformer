    "description": "Data Type: Birds;  Although the Copper River Delta supports the largest concentration of shorebirds in the Western Hemisphere each spring, baseline information is lacking on the relative abundance of shorebirds, their spatial and temporal distribution patterns, and their key concentration areas. This lack of knowledge is of particular concern given the potential for degradation of habitats resulting from increased offshore and Prince William Sound shipping activities. Low-altitude aerial shoreline surveys at high tide every two to three days across the Delta, are being used to estimate phenology, relative abundance and distribution of shorebirds in spring.",
