The survey occurred in May and July - August, 2003 with a coverage area from the western end of Prince William Sound to Kodiak Island.  Salinity, temperature, nitrate, and chlorophyll data were collected.\n\n  A Sea-Air-Land Modeling and Observing Network (SALMON) Project, in conjunction with the Northeast Pacific GLOBEC program.",
