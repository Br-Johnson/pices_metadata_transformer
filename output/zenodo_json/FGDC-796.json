    "description": "Data Type: TERRAIN UNITS;   This dataset is a digital depiction of the Walker, 1983 terrain unit mapping of the Arctic Refuge coastal plain. Five terrain unit types were described for a major portion of the 1002 study area of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Each terrain unit delineates a combined characterization of dominant soils, landforms and vegetation types. Portions of the map were extended geographically, using LANDSAT TM interpretations and aerial photography. Two original terrain classes, Floodplains and Hilly Coastal plain, were further subdivided into east and west for USFWS purposes of this dataset.",

    "notes": "Purpose: These data provide a depiction of terrain units that combine a characterization of soils, landforms, and vegetation. These data were integrated as ancillary data in the spectral analysis of the 1994 USFWS 1002 TM LANDSAT Landcover map for the 1002 study area. This dataset is useful for a variety of resource applications, resource evaluations and habitat analysis.\n\nStatus: In Progress\n\nMaintenance frequency: Unknown\n\nAccess constraints: None\n\nUse constraints: None\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
