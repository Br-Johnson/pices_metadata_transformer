    "notes": "Purpose: Studying the biogeochemical flux at ocean station papa.\n\nSupplemental Information: Risk Justification: Custodian will be leaving soon and has a large quantity of data not secured in a regional data centre.\nRisk of Loss: High\nImpact Justification: Long term time series (more than 10 years)\nImpact of Loss: High\nRecommended Action: Bring data to archives\nAdditional Info: Station P4 is at La Perouse.\n\nStatus: In work\n\nMaintenance frequency: None planned\n\nAccess constraints: May Be Private\n\nUse constraints: Data before 1994 have been published and can be released. Data after 1994 have not been released. Fe/Al/Cd data have not been quality checked, and therefore are not to be released.\n\nDistribution liability: [unknown]\n\nFGDC metadata date: 20080207\n\nFGDC metadata standard: FGDC Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata\n\nFGDC metadata version: FGDC-STD-1998-1\n\nNative data set environment: Expected Growth Rate: Null\n\nData quality - Logical consistency: For C:N, biogenic silicate, CaCO3: subsamples of one sample, collected at P26, are analyzed with each set of data to check for continuity.  Zooplankton that likely swam into the trap are removed. Silicate concentrations are compared to prepared standards.\nData quality - Completeness: Dataset Complications: Many gaps in the data due to malfunctioning equipment or difficulty retrieving the traps. Traps were deployed at stations P12, P16, and P20 from 1995-1998 only.\nLineage - Process steps:\n  1. Unknown\n\nDistribution liability: [unknown]\nNon-digital ordering: Hardcopy Original Exists: Y\nHardcopy Locations: Janet Barwell-Clarke, Rm 1408, IOS\nHardcopy Description: Binders of data sheets\nHardcopy Volume: about 4 2in. binders\nPhysical Sample Exists: Y\nPhysical Sample Locations: Janet Barwell-Clarke, Rm 1411, IOS\nPhysical Sample Volume: several hundred\nPhysical Sample Description: Vials of dried sediment in various formats: some are on filters, some are not.\nPhysical Sample Complications: Early samples were poorly labelled; it may be difficult to determine their origin.Some of the early biogenic silicate fractions were poorly labelled (several hundred).\nFees: Ask Custodian\n\nFGDC metadata date: 20080207\nFGDC metadata standard: FGDC Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata (version: FGDC-STD-1998-1)",
