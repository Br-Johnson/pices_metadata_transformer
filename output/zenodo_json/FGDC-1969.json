    "description": "Deep on the bottom of the sea, in one of the most remote parts of Alaska, let alone the planet, lie some of the most beautiful coral gardens the world has - for the most part - never seen. And now these same coral beds have taken center stage in a battle to protect the waters off Alaska from overfishing. Doug Schneider has more in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio.",

    "notes": "Purpose: surface, and hundreds of miles from the closest city, Bob Stone of the National Marine Fisheries Service lies flat on his side, cramped into a two-person submersible, and peers out a small porthole. Beyond the one-and-a-half-inch thick Plexiglasï¾™ window is a world steeped in darkness. As the submersible reaches the bottom of a submarine canyon, the pilot turns on the floodlights and a video camera. Suddenly, Stone's world is filled with the truly amazing colors and fantastic shapes of a deep-sea coral garden.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: None\n\nUse constraints: None\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
