    "description": "Data Type: Elevation;  This layer contains a shaded relief representation of elevation for Prince William Sound, the Copper River Delta, and eastern Kenai Peninsula. Pacific GIS derived this layer from an elevation coverage (elev63) based on digital elevation model (DEM) data at 1:63,360 scale. The shading is a mathematically calculated value to provide the illusion of a terrain surface being illuminated by an implied light source. It is useful as a back-drop for other data because it gives an intuitive view of the landscape.",
