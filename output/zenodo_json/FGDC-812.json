    "description": "Data Type: Base Maps  ;Township boundaries were generated using Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) computer programs for the construction of digital aliquot parts. The programs make calculations from the radian measurements representing township corner coordinates (AEH coordinate files). At the time when this version of the township coverage was constructed, both DNR and BLM stored their radian measurements to ten positions of accuracy. In general, this resulted in digital placement of the township lines within a meter of their protracted, NAD27, latitude-longitude positions.",
