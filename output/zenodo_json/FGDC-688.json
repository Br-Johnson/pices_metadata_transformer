    "description": "Data Type: Exxon Valdez Oil Spill;  GIS database produced as a result of the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill (EVOS) for Natural Resources Damage Assessment (NRDA). Data was collected under the supervision of the Alaska Department of Environment Conservation (ADEC) with the goal to map and monitor all know locations of beached oil. The ADEC cumulative shoreline oiling through August 1989 provided NRDA with the most comprehensive shoreline oiling data. These observations were based on fixed-wing, helicopter, and on-site records made by a limited number of trained ADEC personnel and backed by a formal ADEC documentation process. The information represents the cumulative oil impact from March 28, 1989 to the end of the month which was reported. The intended use of the dataset is for spill damage identification, oil spill response, habitat restoration activities.",
