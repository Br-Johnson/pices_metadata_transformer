    "description": "Regulations have been implemented to control the incidental take of \"prohibited species\" (halibut, herring, salmon, and crab) in eastern Bering Sea Groundfish fisheries. Regulatory measures have included bycatch limits, seasons, gear restrictions, area closures, bycatch rate standards, monitoring and enforcement. A brief historical review of these measures is provided. Collectively, these measures have undoubtedly served to control potential bycatch and associated mortality of prohibited species.",
