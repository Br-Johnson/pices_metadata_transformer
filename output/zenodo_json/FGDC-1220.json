    "description": "Quasi-synoptic sampling along a transect from Alaska to California carried out in spring and summer 2000 using Continuous Plankton Recorders reveals that the abundant calanoid copepod Neocalanus plumchrus (Marukawa) reaches the surface at approximately the same time across the region.  However, monthly sampling also reveals that the timing of peak biomass (when 50% of the population consists of copepodites at stage CV) occurs about 5 weeks earlier at the southernmost part of its range than at the northernmost part, with intermediate areas having intermediate timings. Surface water temperature differed by about 4Â°C between the warmer south and the cooler north, and we suggest that such a difference would reduce development duration by about 3 weeks. If food supply in the north is more conducive to lipid accumulation, as seems possible from phytoplankton biomass data, then the use of the differences in timing of peak N. plumchrus biomass in each area as a measure of the differences in development time may not be accurate. We find that the estimate of the time of peak biomass varying by about 5 weeks between north and south may be an exaggeration of the actual difference in the development duration. Temperature is probably the most important factor governing the shorter development duration of N. plumchrus in southern latitudes.  \n\n[ Reference: Batten, S.D., Welch, D.W., and Jonas, T. 2003.
