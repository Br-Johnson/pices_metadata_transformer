    "description": "When an American wheat farmer loses his crop to a flood or drought, insurance he purchased from the federal government helps cushion the blow. As Doug Schneider\nreports in this weekﾒs Arctic Science Journeys Radio, Alaskaﾒs beleaguered salmon fishermen may soon be able to insure their \"crop\" against disaster as well.",

    "notes": "Purpose: Alaska is famous for salmon runs that set records one year, only to plummet the next. It's a natural boom-and-bust cycle about which fishermen have long complained, but until now couldn't really do anything about. That may soon change, as the U.S. Department of  Agriculture the same agency that helps farmers insure their crops against locusts, droughts, floods, and other disasters looks to offer insurance to salmon fishermen in\nAlaska's Bristol Bay. Mark Herrmann is a fisheries economist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required.\n\nUse constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
