    "description": "Field sampling will be used observing walruses resting on ice using 10 x 40 binoculars by a distance from 200 - 500 meters.  Each will be scored for age class and among mature animals for sex based on facial morphology.  Males and females will be distinguished from facial shapes as well as tusk length and snout width.\n\nAn NPMR project",
