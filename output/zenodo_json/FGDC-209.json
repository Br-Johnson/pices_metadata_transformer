Available indices are: EA.IAS (East Atlantic Pattern); EA_JET.IAS (East Atlantic Jet Pattern); EA_WR.IAS (East Atlantic/Western Russia Pattern); EP.IAS (East Pacific Pattern); EUR.IAS; (Eurasian Pattern); NAO.IAS; (North American Oscillation Pattern); NP.IAS (North Pacific Pattern); PNA.IAS (Pacific North America Pattern); SCAN.IAS (Scandinavian Pattern); S_OSC.IAS (Southern Oscillation Index); WA.IAS (Western North Atlantic Index); WP.IAS (Western Pacific Pattern). IOS on-line versions are presently prepared and maintained by Howard Freeland.\n\nPSARC_Utility\nSeveral of these indices have been used in correlation-type studies of production/growth/survival of oceanic fish stocks. The Southern  Oscillation Index is frequently used to detect El Nino conditions and to describe the magnitude of the El Nino event.\n\nImprovements\nAutomate the update process and provide additional file options (IOS Header and or CSV spreadsheet format). Create public directory for these or add them to our INTERNET WWW server site.\n\nOther Comments\nUpdated around the 10th of each month. Also available through anonymous ftp to nic.fb4.noaa.gov:/pub/cac/cddb/indices\n\nBase Internet/URL\nhttp://nic.fb4.noaa.gov/\n\nA TCODE project",
