    "description": "Our objective is to put in place a monitoring program for the eastern North Pacific and southern Bering Sea region. Large scale changes in Pacific salmon populations in all regions of North America have been related to climate change in this century. The likely initial cause is changes in the structure of the ocean and atmosphere. These changes are known to affect the abundance, productivity, and community structure of continental shelf and open ocean plankton communities. Changes in plankton abundance have been related to the changes in salmon abundance, and reduced ocean productivity is probably the causal link leading to poor ocean survival for salmon. Climate changes experienced in recent years are consistent with expectations from models for early stages of global warming. In all regions of the West Coast of North America there have been extremely sudden changes in the productivity of salmon populations. These changes have not been expected from the standard fisheries management theories, nor could they be forecast from available data. However, the changes have had devastating economic impacts on coastal communities from Oregon to (most recently) Alaska. The pattern of failure in year-class strength of Bristol Bay sockeye salmon and other stocks and species demonstrates that the cause of the sudden downturn has in large part a marine origin. However, salmon spend part of their life history in both coastal and oceanic marine environments, and are therefore subject to environmental changes occurring in both regions. \n\nWe seek to put in place a monitoring framework using the Hardy Continuous  Plankton Recorder (CPR). This is an established technology widely used in the North Atlantic. The changes that the Atlantic CPR program have documented in the 1990s are now being linked to the decline in Atlantic salmon populations, that are also experiencing substantially increased ocean mortality.\n\nOur project involves sampling of the plankton in multiple regions of the offshore and coastal regions of the eastern North Pacific and southern Bering Sea. The monitoring lines will (a) sample the plankton along the coastal migration routes of the juvenile salmon in four locations, (b) quantify the distribution and abundance of shelf plankton populations in the Atlantic (Steele 1998; the relationship of shelf to offshore populations is unclear in the Pacific because of a lack of data), and (c) permit cross-comparisons with almost all existing eastern Pacific ocean surveys (CalCOFI in California; Line P in Canada; and GAK-1 near Seward, Alaska).\n\nThis project also includes; Dr. Sonia Batten, Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science, 1 Walker Terrace, The Hoe, Plymouth, United Kingdom PL1 3BN,\n44 1752 221-112\nsoba@wpo.nerc.ac.uk\nAn NPMR project",
