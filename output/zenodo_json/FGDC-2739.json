    "description": "NOAA-4 satellite photos of roll clouds over the Bering Sea are used to derive quantitative information as to how the interval between the clouds (lambda) changes with distance south of the edge of the ice pack. Radiosondes are utilized to obtain values of the boundary-layer height (h) at St. Paul Island. The magnitude of lambda/h is calculated for a number of cases and is compared to that expected from theory. A number of values obtained (6-7:1) differ significantly from the normally expected values (2-3:1) for circular vortices.",
