    "description": "Data Type: Exxon Valdez Oil Spill;  Three zones assigned in Alaska defined by four criteria: 1)physical parameters, 2)biological parameters, 3)near shore human use activities and 4) time required to respond. These zones were used by DEC to determine spatially what oiled areas would be considered for use of oil dispersants in the response phase of EVOS. Boundaries of these zones should be considered general approximations.",
