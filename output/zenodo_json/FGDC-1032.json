    "description": "The remote detection of a seismic swarm on the northern Gorda Ridge on 28 February 1996 prompted a three-cruise response effort to\ninvestigate event and chronic hydrothermal discharge associated with a dike intrusion. The GR1 cruise reached the northern Gorda only\n10 days after seismicity began and discovered a 15 km diameter event plume, EP96A, centered between depths 1800 and 2800 m above\nthe shallowest portion of the axial valley axis (~3100 m). One month later, GR2 returned and found only a weak, near-bottom chronic\nplume at the EP96A site. A few kilometers to the south, however, GR2 mapped a distinctly different chronic plume (~2500-2900 m\ndepth) as well as the edge of a second event plume, EP96B (~1800-2400-m depth), above the western wall of the axial valley. EP96B\nwas seeded with a neutrally buoyant float, which traveled 10 net km to the northwest before surfacing on 10 June at the start of GR3.\nMapping around the float location fully revealed EP96B, a 10 km diameter plume with a heat content ~25% that of EP96A. Extensive\nobservations within the axial valley determined that chronic venting was effectively exhausted within three months. Models seeking to\nexplain the perturbation of hydrothermal venting by a dike intrusion and eruption must satisfy several criteria generalized from this and\nprevious events: (1) venting begins (or increases) with the intrusion/eruption and declines exponentially afterwards, (2) the time scale of the\npost-intrusion decline varies within and among sites, (3) the discharge of multiple event plumes is common, (4) an existing\nhigh-temperature vent field may not be necessary or even conducive to event plume formation, and (5) the ratio of total chronic to event\ndischarge varies among intrusion events.",
