    "description": "The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) is a Department of Defense program which is responsible for designing, building, launching and operating polar orbiting meteorological satellites. The satellites can broadcast visual,\ninfrared and microwave imagery directly to transportable tactical sites around the world. The data is also stored for transmission to the Navy's Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center (FNMOC) and to the Air Force\nGlobal Weather Central (AFGWC).\n \n  Each of the DMSP satellites flies in a sun-synchronous, near-polar orbit. For a satellite in sun synchronous orbit, the ascending equatorial crossing time remains relatively constant with respect to the local time throughout the lifetime of the satellite.\n \n  The SSM/T1 consists of seven microwave channels with atmospheric sensitivity in the oxygen absorption band, at frequencies ranging from 50.5 to 59.4 GHz, with one channel acting as a surface window channel. The SSM/T1completes one scan of seven earth view measurements and two calibration measurements every 32 seconds. The total swath width for the SSM/T1 is approximately 1600 km.",
