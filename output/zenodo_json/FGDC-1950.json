    "description": "Subsistence fishing for fall chum salmon opened this week on the Chandalar River, a tributary of the Yukon River north of Fairbanks. Fisheries managers opened the season after 74,000 fall chums passed a sonar counting station operated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The opening is sure to help the Native villages of Venetie and Fort Yukon, two rural communities that depend on subsistence harvests of fish and game. Recently, Arctic Science Journeys Radio reporter Doug Schneider visited the Chandalar River sonar station to learn more about how biologists count migrating salmon.",
