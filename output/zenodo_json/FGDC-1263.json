    "description": "For people who live in Alaska, encounters with wildlife are just part of the daily routine. It's one of the reasons  many of us endure long winter months for the chance to see a moose nose pressed against a window, or a porcupine waddle through the yard, or a fox, mouse dangling from its jaw, lope across the road. But sometimes, encounters with\nwildlife aren't exactly welcome. In this week's Arctic Science Journeys radio, writer and editor Andy Hall recalls one eye-opening experience with a hungry bear.",
