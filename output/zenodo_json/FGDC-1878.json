    "description": "Time-series data collected by the Yellow Sea Fisheries Research Institute (YSFRI) mainly focused on the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea.  The surveys were conducted only by bottom trawl at different years since the mid-1980s.  The stations of bottom trawl  surveys were all predetermined.  The data include temperature, salinity, nutrients, plankton, invertebrate, species composition of trawl, length, weight, stomach contents of fish, etc.    The hydroacoustic/trawl surveys have been used to assess the stock biomass in the Yellow Sea and sometimes in the East China Sea, for such species as Japanese anchovy (Engraulis japonicus), largehead hairtail (Trichiurus haumela) and sardine (Sardinops melanosticta).  During the stock assessment surveys, environmental parameters were also collected at the same time.  Those parameters are useful for studying ecosystem changes and may influence the ecosystem and biodiversity in the sea.  \n\n[ Reference: PICES Scientific Report No. 18 2001, Proceedings of the PICES/CoML/IPRC Workshop on \"Impact of Climate Variability on Observation and Prediction of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes in the North Pacific\", http://www.pices.int/publications/scientific_reports/Report18/default.aspx. ]",
