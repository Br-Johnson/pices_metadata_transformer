Gear type, exact fishing location, and fishing period are collected whenever possible.\n\nMeasurement Details\nFor aboriginal fisheries with pilot sales agreements, band administered catch monitoring programs are in place.  Band members must land at designated landing sites and have their catch counted by monitors.  A landing record is completed for each landing during a fishing period.\n\nGeographic Area\nBritish Columbia and Yukon\n\nOther Comments\nData have not been collected in a consistent manner over the years or for all areas.\n\n[ A TCODE project ]",
