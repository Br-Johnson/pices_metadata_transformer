    "description": "This 10-page document presents information on the distribution of over 200 invertebrates, fishes, marine mammals, and seabirds found in the donut hole region of the Bering Sea. Presence-absence data are included for the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), the USSR (now Russian) EEZ, and other Bering Sea waters. The data for each species are organized within four categories: 1) adult presence; 2) adult abundance; 3) reproduction; and 4) commercial fishing grounds. The information was\ncompiled from the work done for NOAA's Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort Seas Strategic Assessment Data Atlas and West Coast of North America Strategic Assessment Data Atlas. \n\nNOAAServer Codes: [OL 72 55 -130 -168] ; nodateline obtain",
