    "description": "This report evaluates the usefulness of simulation models in aiding understanding of fur seal population dynamics and interactions between fur seal populations and fisheries in the Eastern Bering Sea.  To this end, available fur seal and Bering sea fisheries data are summarized and discussed available models for fish and fur seals are reviewed and evaluated and a  number of studies of interspecific interactions involving marine mammals are  considered.",
