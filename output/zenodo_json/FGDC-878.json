    "description": "Data Type: Mammals;   The movements of telemetered marine mammals in Alaskan waters are tracked through the use of CAMRIS (Computer Aided Mapping and Resource Inventory System), a small GIS system. This dataset stores shorelines, bathymetry, animal locations and tracks. Sea surface temperature and ice edge formation is also incorporated. This system contains data from the equator to the north pole. This system incorporates animals tagged using the ARGOS radiotags.",
