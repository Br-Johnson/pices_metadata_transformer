    "description": "Group:  Summary DMSP-F11 daily, total and multi-year sea ice concentration\ngrids are derived from the SSM/I daily brightness temperatures.  With a\nresolution of 25X25 km, these sea ice concentrations are presented as\nraster images (HDF raster image sets, RIS) mapped to polar stereographic\nprojections depicting north and south polar regions. Data are stored in\nHDF and packaged in compressed tar format. These ice concentrations\ncontinue the series begun with DMSP-F8 SSM/I coverage, generated using the\nNASA Team algorithm. Processing is continuous on the F11 data, beginning 3\nDecember 1991.  The DMSP-F8 and -F11 data demonstrate a high degree of\ncorrelation (Abdalati et al. 1995) although regression coefficients are\napplied in the development of F11 ice concentrations in order to maintain\nconsistency of the data set (NSIDC 1995). Data are available via ftp\n(sidads.colorado.edu, IP address 128.138.135.20).",
