    "description": "As part of the U.S. JGOFS Program and the NOAA Ocean-Atmosphere Carbon Exchange Study (OACES), measurements of CO partial pressure were made in\nthe atmosphere and in the surface waters of the central and eastern equatorial Pacific during the boreal spring and autumn of 1992, the spring of 1993, and the\nspring and autumn of 1994. Surface-water pCO data indicate significant diurnal, seasonal, and interannual variations. The largest variations were associated with the\n1991-1994 ENSO event, which reached maximum intensity in the spring of 1992. The lower values of surface water pCO observed during the 1991-1994\nENSO period were the result of the combined effects of both remotely and locally forced physical processes. The warm pool, which reached a maximum eastward\nextent in January-February of 1992, began in September of 1991 as a series of westerly wind events lasting about 30 days. Each wind event initiated an\neastward-propagating Kelvin wave which caused a deepening of the thermocline. By the end of January 1992 the thermocline was at its maximum depth, so that the\nupwelled water was warm and CO-depleted. In April of the same year, the local winds were weaker than normal, and the upwelling was from shallow depths.\nThese changes resulted in a lower-than-normal CO flux to the atmosphere. The results show that for the one-year period from the fall of 1991 until the fall of 1992,\napproximately 0.3 GtC were released to the atmosphere; 0.6 GtC were released in 1993, and 0.7 GtC in 1994, in good agreement with the model results of Ciais\net al. [Science, 269, 1098-1102; J. Geophys. Res., 100, 5051-5070]. The net reduction of the ocean-atmosphere CO flux during the 1991-1994 El Ni嚙得 was on\nthe order of 0.8-1.2 GtC. Thus, the total amount of CO sequestered in the equatorial oceans during the prolonged 1991-1994 El Ni嚙得 period was about 25%\nhigher than the severe El Ni嚙得 of 1982-1983.",
