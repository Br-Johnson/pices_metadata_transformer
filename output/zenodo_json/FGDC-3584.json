    "description": "The Salmon Project is in the process of deploying new High Frequency (HF) Radar instrumentation which will provide unprecedented coverage of sea surface currents in Alaskan waters. These surface current mappers (SCMs) are instruments manufactured by CODAR (Coastal Ocean Dynamic Applications Radar) Ocean Sensors in Los Altos, California. They will be phased into operation through the spring and summer of 2004 at remote sites in Prince William Sound and the Northern Gulf of Alaska. These prototype power and telemetry systems are currently in their final testing phase at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. The funding for these systems is being provided by grants awarded by The National Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA) and The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\n  A Sea-Air-Land Modeling and Observing Network (SALMON) Project.",
