    "description": "This report is a compilation of the data resulting from a collaborative research project conducted in Vancouver Harbour, Canada.  This scientific study was part of a Practical Workshop sponsored by the Marine Environmental Quality Committee of the North Pacific Marine Science Organization (PICES).  The goal of the workshop was to promote the exchange of information about approaches used by PICES member countries to assess the biological impact of marine pollution.  Section I of this report provides an overview and history of the workshop, the work plan and methods used to conduct the workshop, and summary that includes recommendations for future practical workshops of this nature.  Section II provides a description of the physical and oceanographic characteristics of the samplign area, as well as information on contaminant sources.\n\n\n   [ LC Call No. GC781 .P535 no.16.
