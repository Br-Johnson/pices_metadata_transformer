    "description": "Detailed measurements of the concentration, composition, size, and morphology of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the eastern\nequatorial Pacific Ocean were made during separate cruises in 1975 and 1976. SPM concentrations in the surface waters (0-300 m)\nwere highly variable (~30 ± 18 µg/1) and primarily dependent on the concentration of biogenic material which accounted for >90% of the\ntotal SPM. Mean Si/Al, K/Al, Ti/Al ratios were significantly higher than the corresponding values for the underlying sediments, indicating\nprobable concentration of these elements in biogenic matter and other nonaluminosilicate phases. Mn/Al ratios, however, were close to or\neven less than the sediment values. Particle concentrations, mean size, and Si/Al, K/Al, Ti/Al, and Fe/Al ratios all decreased from the\nsurface waters to the top of the bottom nepheloid layer (BNL), indicating progressive dissolution and a concomitant remineralization of\nassociated elements. However, nonaluminosilicate phases still accounted for more than 40-70% of the Si, K, Ti, and Fe in the deep water\nzone. After deposition, most of this nonaluminosilicate phase is either transformed into authigenic smectites or dissolved and released back\ninto the water column. Within the BNL (approximately the bottom 400 m of the water column), concentration increases of Al, Si, K, Ti,\nMn, and Fe averaged 201%, 74%, 46%, 78%, 200%, and 119%, respectively, greater than the overlying waters, whereas total SPM\nincreased only 20-40%. Chemical mass-balance calculations suggest that this BNL concentration increase is due to resuspension of\naluminosilicates and hydrogenous Mn from the 1 µm fraction of the local bottom sediments.",
