    "description": "Data on abundance of biota, sea lion diet, and biochemical content of fish were collected. During the cruises, prey abundance and biomass were measured using echo-integration and midwater trawl.  Sea lion scat was collected during the Frederick Sound leg of the cruise at haulouts on Sail Island and Southwest Brothers Island  to infer sea lion diet.  Fish also were collected for proximate and fatty acid analysis.",

    "notes": "Purpose: Cruises five and six of the 2002 Southeast Alaska Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus) prey study were conducted in Lynn Canal on 6-7 September and in Frederick Sound on 8-16 September aboard the chartered fishing vessel Viking Storm.  Well into the second year of the study, these cruises mark the second opportunity for interannual comparison.   The purpose of the study is to test the hypothesis that juvenile Steller sea lion prey diversity and seasonality are related to Steller sea lion population trends.  It is a comparison study to a research program concurrently conducted near Kodiak Island by the University of Alaska.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: Unknown\n\nAccess constraints: None\n\nUse constraints: Contact the agency.\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
