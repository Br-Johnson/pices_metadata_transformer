    "description": "CTD data are  collected from cruises in the Gulf of Alaska since 1981. These  data are high  resolution vertical profiles of conductivity, temperature, and pressure.  Additional sensors may include dissolved oxygen or other biological/chemical sensors (nephelometers, fluorometers).The data are stored on 5,592 disk files (47.8 MB) at the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory in Seattle, Washington.",
