    "description": "This report presents oceanographic data collected at fishing stations in the North Pacific and the Bering Sea from May to September 1958, as a part of the research conducted by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service under the direction of the United States Section of the International North Pacific Fisheries Commission.  The also describes procedures and shows stations occupied by the fishing vessels \"Attu\", and  \"Pioneer\".  The tabulated data show temperature and values of salinity density dissolved oxygen and dissolved inorganic phosphate at varying depths to 1050 meters, numbers, time and position of drift bottle release; time position and weather and sea conditions for bathythermograph lowerings; and displacement volumes, wet weights and numbers of organisms per cubic meter of water for the vertical plankton hauls.\n\n  [Reference: Favorite, F. and G.
