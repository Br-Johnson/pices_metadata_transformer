    "description": "Data Type: Mammals;   National Marine Fisheries, Marine Mammal Lab in cooperation with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game collects and catalogs location data for sea lion rookeries and haulouts and critical habitats and collects associated data pertaining to ongoing research on population study, wintering habitats, annual pup counts, and studies related to rookeries, behavior, tagging, reproduction, and feeding Satellite radio telemetry data is also collected in the eastern Gulf of Alaska, at Cape St. Elias, Kodiak and in Southeast Alaska. A variety of systems such as ARC/INFO and CAMRIS (Computer Aided Mapping and Resources Inventory System) and various database systems have been used to store and analyze this data over time. As of 1994, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game has launched an effort to begin using ARC/INFO to analyze the distribution and abundance data to evaluate sea lion critical habitats. This data is the GIS application of the same data set in National Marine Fisheries, Marine Fisheries Lab, metadata record #070.",
