    "description": "This report provides new findings and recent research results, and review on-going and in-planning international and domestic projects to improve cooperative research.  The workshop discussion focused mainly on physical oceanography, and talks covered a wide range of research: sea-ice characteristics and its movements; the relation between ice-cover and atmospheric conditions; sea-ice and dense water (NPIW) formation; ventilation and modification of water masses; tides and their effects on water mixing and on water exchanges through straits; meso-scale eddies, yearly to decadal temporal variations, oceanographic databases and atlases; and the relation of the oceanic state to spawning grounds and to the nutrient and chlorophyll-a distributions. Relations of these to local environments such as the northern Okhotsk Sea Shelf, on the Sakhalin and west Kamchatka shelves, in the Kuril Islands region, and in the Soya (La Peoruse) Strait and northern coast of Hokkaido, were discussed.\n   [ LC Call No. GC781 .P535 no.12.
