    "description": "In 1983-85 the National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NMML), Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC), conducted a study using bomb calorimetry procedures to obtain additional data on the total energy content of entire specimens of known and probable prey species.  A total of 267 fish and 11 squid specimens were collected in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska during the routine assessment surveys conducted by the AFSC during 1984.  In addition, 10 squid specimens collected on marine mammal-fisheries interactions research cruises in the North Pacific Ocean during 1981 and 1982 were also included in this study.  A total of 18 fish and 5 squid species were analyzed in the study.\n\n\n  [Reference: Perez, M. A. 1994. Calorimetry measurements of energy value of some Alaska fishes and squids. U.S. Dep.
