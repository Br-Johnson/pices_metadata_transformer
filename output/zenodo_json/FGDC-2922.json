    "description": "This report references population abundance data of algal species: Alaria spp., Fucus spp., and Laminaria spp. and invertebrate species: Clinocardium nuttali, Dermasterias imbricata, Evasterias  troschelii, Littorina scutulata, Littorina sitkana, Macoma brota, Macoma inconspicua, Macoma irus, Macoma nasuta, Mya arenaria, Mya truncata, Mytilus spp., Mytilus  trossulus, Pisaster ochraceus, Protothaca staminea, Pycnopodia helianthoides, Saxidomus giganteus, and Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis from various areas of Prince William Sound, Alaska.  References areas include: Anderson Bay, Beartrack Bay, Blackstone Bay, Chenega Cove, Deep Bay, English Bay, Galena Bay, Goose Island, Hanning Bay, Heather Island, Humpback Creek, Knowles Head, MacLeod Point, Naked Island, Olsen Bay, Orca Bay, Port Etches, Port Nellie Juan, Port Wells, Saddie Point, Sawmill Bay, Shepard Point, Shipyard Bay, South Bay, Spike Island, Stockdale Harbor, Thumb Bay, West Twin Bay, Whiskey Cove, and Zaikof Bay.\n\n  The aforementioned data are referenced in citation: Haven, S. B. Effects of Land-level Changes on Intertidal invertebrates, with Discussion of Postearthquake Ecological Succession. Prince William Sound Survey Expedition. pp.82-126.\n\n  This literature was collected as part of a metadatabase that represents one or more nearshore resources (from physical attributes such as water and air, to birds and mammals).  Each entry is viewable in three formats, 1) a geospatial explicit format (ArcView 3.3) named GIS ArcView 3.3 Near GEM project, 2) a spreadsheet format (Excel 2002 and within ArcView) named GEM Nearshore Metadata Set, and 3) a ProCite database named GEM Nearshore Metadata References, which consists of references included in 1 and 2 above.  The ProCite database record number corresponds to the Excel Procite Number.  Reference Procite #441 for this literature's metadata.\n\n  The metadata are maintained in digital format (ArcView 3.3, Excel 2002, and Procite) and are available from the Alaska Science Center, USGS in Anchorage, Alaska.\n\n  For a detailed description of the three databases and the project, see \"Bodkin, J. L., and T. Dean.  2003.
