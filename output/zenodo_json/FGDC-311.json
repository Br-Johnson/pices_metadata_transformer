    "description": "The population area of the agarophyte Ahnfeltia tobuchiensis (kanno et Matsubara) Makienko in the Bay of Izmena is 23.3 km2.  In this its biomass used for agar production in Russia is 125,000 tons.  A. tobuchiensis forms an unattached stratum up to 1 m thick on the sandy and silty-sandy bottom.  The influence of environmental factors on the production indices of A. tobuchiensis population was studied at 14 most characteristic stations during the summer period.",
