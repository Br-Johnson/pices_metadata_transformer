    "description": "Synoptic observations taken aboard ships of opportunity, research vessels, and navy ships.  All standard surface meteorological elements are recorded.  In addition, sea surface temperature, ice accretion, and wave direction/height are most often observed.  The data set contains observations received from Global Telecommunications System (GTS) international exchange and ships logs.  Observations usually taken at 4 main GMT synoptic hours but some 3-hourly intermediate observations also are included.  Recent (1970's) adjunct data set contains permanent and drifting buoy data (TD-1132). Data consists of approximately 328 reels CCT at 6250 bpi and the bytes per record are variable.",
