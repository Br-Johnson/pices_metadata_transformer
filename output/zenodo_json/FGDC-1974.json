    "description": "Some very tiny plants play a very big role in the world's oceans, but there aren't as many of these plants as there used to be. As Doug Schneider reports in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio, global warming is reducing the levels of phytoplankton in the world's oceans, and that includes the North Pacific Ocean off Alaska.",
