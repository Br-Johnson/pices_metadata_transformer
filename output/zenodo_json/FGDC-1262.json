    "description": "As biologists and fishermen search for the cause of Western Alaska salmon declines, scientists say the state's Yukon River chum salmon are getting smaller. What's more, it seems to be a trend affecting salmon returning to at least one river in Russia as well. Doug Schneider has more in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio.",

    "notes": "Purpose: Chum salmon returning to Alaska's Yukon River and the Anadyr River in Russia have gotten steadily smaller since  the 1960s. That's the conclusion drawn from a study of\nsalmon growth done by state, university and federal researchers.\n\nBill Smoker, a fisheries scientist from the University of Alaska Fairbanks School of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences,  announced the study's preliminary findings at a scientific\nconference in Fairbanks late last week.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required.\n\nUse constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
