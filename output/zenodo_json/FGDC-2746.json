    "description": "A one-layer, primitive equation model is presented for the atmospheric boundary layer over the marginal ice zone (MIZ). The model simulates the slow rate of inversion growth and rate of warming of the boundary layer seaward of an ice edge for off-ice winds observed on two cruises in the Bering Sea by the NOAA R/V SURVEYOR. The horizontal temperature gradient in the boundary layer, caused by the oceanic heat flux seaward of an ice edge, induced an increase in wind speed with a maximum increase of 8% at 50 km seaward of the edge. At 100 km off ice, a momentum balance is established between accelerative terms (boundary layer baroclinity, momentum entrainment, synoptic-scale scale pressure gradient) and decelerative terms (surface drag and the local pressure force resulting from inversion rise). Wind velocity in the boundary layer over the MIZ during off-ice winds is sensitive to changes in surface roughness. When an MIZ is modeled as a smooth interior (CD = 2 ￗ 10-3) and a 30-km-wide rough marginal ice zone (CD = 3.8 ￗ 10-3) with an unstable surface layer over the ocean, the model shows a decrease in wind speed of 9% at the windward side of the MIZ and an 18% increase in wind speed from 5 km interior to the ice edge to 40 km seaward of the edge. These results suggest an atmospheric mechanism for rafting at the windward side of the marginal ice zone, divergence of the ice at the edge, and ice-band formation seaward of the edge.",
