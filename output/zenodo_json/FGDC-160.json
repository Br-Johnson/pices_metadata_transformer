    "description": "Approximately 2,492 km of 24-channel seismic-reflection\nprofiles are now available for the Eastern Gulf of Alaska.  The\nprofiles were collected by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) on\nthe USGS Research Vessel S.P. LEE during the summer of 1977 (USGS\nOpen File Report 84-6).*  A sound source of five airguns was used\nwith a volume of 1,326 cu. in. of air compressed to approximately\n1,950 psi.  The recording system consisted of a 24-group\nstreamer, 2,400 m long and a GUS (Global Universal Science) model\n4200 recording instrument.  Shots were fired every 50 m with a\ngroup interval of 100 m.  A 2-msec sampling rate was used in the\nfield.  The data were later desampled to 4 msec during the\ndemultiplexing process.  Navigational control for the survey was\nobtained with a Marconi integrated satellite-Doppler sonar\nnavigation system.",
