    "description": "Fractal analysis and Fourier analysis are independent techniques for quantitatively describing the variability of natural figures. Both methods have been applied to a\nvariety of natural phenomena. Previous analytical work has formulated relationships between the fractal dimension and power law form frequency spectrum.\nMandelbrot (1985) has shown that difficulties arise when the ruler method for measuring dimensionality is applied to other than self-similar figures. Since an\ninvestigator presumably does not know in advance the dimensionality of a natural profile, it is essential to quantify the nature of the discrepancy for self-affine cases.\nIn this study, a series of experiments are conducted in which discrete random series of specified spectral forms are analyzed using the fractal ruler method. The\nvarious parameters of the fractal measurement are related to the parameters of the spectral model. In this way, empirical relationships between the techniques can be\nderived for discrete, finite series which simulate the results of applying the fractal method to observational data. The results of the study indicate that there are\nconsiderable discrepancies between the results predicted by theory and those derived empirically. The fundamental power law form of length versus resolution pairs\ndoes not hold over the entire region of analysis. The predicted linear relationship between fractal dimension and exponent of the frequency spectrum does not hold,\nand the spectral signals can be extended beyond the limits of dimension inferred by theory. Root-mean-square variability is also shown to be linearly related to the\nfractal intercept term. An investigation of the effect of nonstationary sampling is conducted by generating signals composed of segments of differing spectral\ncharacteristics. Fractal analyses of these signals appear identical to those conducted on stationary series. The discrepancies between theoretical prediction and\nempirical results described in this study reflect the difficulties of applying analytically derived techniques to measurement data. Both Fourier and fractal techniques are\nformulated through rigorous mathematics, assuming various conditions for the underlying signal. When these techniques are applied to discrete, finite length,\nnonstationary series, certain statistical transformations must be applied to the data. Methods such as windowing, prewhitening, and anti-aliasing filters have been\ndeveloped over many years for use with Fourier analysis. At present, no such statistical theory exists for use with fractal analysis. It is apparent from the results of\nthis study that such a statistical foundation is required before the fractal ruler method can be routinely applied to observation data.",
