    "description": "The national Fisheries Research and Development Institute (NFRDI) of Korea operates NOAA ground receiving station in Kijang (35 11.5'N, 129 13.4'E), eastern part of Busan.  Operation began November 2, 1989 with work is in real time Sea Surface Temperature (SST) mapping in Korean coastal waters derived from NOAA-AVHRR on daily base.  Data includes NOAA data 4-6 times a day in case of satellite elevation more than 30 degrees.  An autoprocess of SST color image has been developed.  \n\n[ Reference: PICES Scientific Report No. 18 2001, Proceedings of the PICES/CoML/IPRC Workshop on \"Impact of Climate Variability on Observation and Prediction of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes in the North Pacific\", http://www.pices.int/publications/scientific_reports/Report18/default.aspx. ]",
