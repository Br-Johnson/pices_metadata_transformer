    "description": "Data Type: Birds;  This theme includes survey design and data for aerial surveys of migratory birds for Prince William Sound and the Kenai Peninsula. It includes: 1) random sample areas used for population estimates, 2) a complete coastal survey performed in 1989, and 3) historical data compiled by Haddock in 1971. The primary purpose of this theme was to analyze data for changes in populations following the spill. Scale is 1:63,360.",
