    "description": "The discovery of a volcanic eruption at the 9°45.52N site on the East Pacific Rise (EPR) led us to investigate how the composition of suspended matter in\nhydrothermal plumes may be used to provide a better understanding of the relative age and vent fluid characteristics of a ridge crest system during surface ship\nsurveys. During the TROUGHS (Tropical Ridge Observations of Underwater Geochemical Hydrothermal Signals) expedition we collected hydrothermal plume\nparticles along a 350 km section, extending from approximately 8°40N to 11°50N, of the EPR north and south of the Clipperton Transform Fault. Over the\nsegment south of the Clipperton Transform Fault, the S/Fe ratio in the particles ranged from about 0.9 to 10, with the highest values immediately over the new vent\nfield at the 9°45.52N site. These enrichments exactly coincide with the elevated He/heat and CH/Mn ratios in the plumes over the same vent field. The S-rich\nparticles are primarily organic and may be related to the \"bacteria blizzard\" associated with the eruption. In addition, very high Cu/Fe and Zn/Fe ratios were\nobserved in the hydrothermal plumes south of the Clipperton Transform Fault. These high ratios are indicative of the predominance of high-temperature, HS-rich\nvents between 9°35N and 9°50N. In contrast, the samples from the segment north of Clipperton Transform Fault had S/Fe ratios which ranged from 0.04 to 0.82,\ntypical of mature, Fe-rich hydrothermal plumes. These results suggest that the gas-rich vent fluids at the 9°45.52N site produced the sulfur-enriched particles in the\nwater column. Gas-rich plumes and sulfur-enriched plume particles were also observed underneath the 1986 Megaplume on the Juan de Fuca Ridge (JdFR),\nsuggesting a similar mode of formation. North of the Clipperton Transform Fault, the hydrothermal particles are dominated by Fe-rich oxyhydroxide particles,\ncharacteristic of mature high-temperature vent fields. The plume maximum is centered at 11°08N. The Fe oxyhydroxide particles scavenge Ca, Si, P, V, Cr and As\nfrom seawater. For P and V the mean element/Fe ratios in the EPR hydrothermal particles are intermediate between JdFR and TAG hydrothermal systems. For As\nthe mean element/Fe ratios of all three systems are about the same. New evidence for Si scavenging by hydrothermal Fe oxyhydroxide particles indicates that this\nsink for dissolved Si in the oceans is small.",
