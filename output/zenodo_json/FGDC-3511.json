    "description": "The SDR (Satellite Data Records) are formatted into the Shared Processing Data Exchange Format (DEF) at the Fleet Numerical Oceanographic Center (FNOC),  Monterey, They are transmitted to NOAA/NESDIS via a communication satellite, processed, and given a data set name to identify it on the NESDIS computer (CEMSCS). There are approximately 14 orbits acquired during a 24-hour period, but only 10 of these orbits will reside on the CEMSCS at any given time. Data is acquired from each of the 2 DMSP polar orbiting satellites, DEFENSE METO SAT PROGRAM-F10  and DEFENSE METO SAT PROGRAM-F11.  \n\nUpon the generation of the above data set, it is converted from the DEF to the Intermediate database (IDB) format. Each data set has up to 1725 records of 3348 eight-bit bytes of data and is stored into the IDB as one of 30 blocks aligned to 1725 records boundaries. The alignment is based upon the orbit number.  \n\nThe IDB is generated by processing FNOC data sets into a rotating database of 30 sequences. The first record of each of the sequences is composed of 6 data ID blocks from the first DEF text field and put into a zero filled record of 3348 bytes. The data part of the record consists of a 12 byte \"Scan Header Block\" and 3346 bytes of the \"Data Block\" which are written to a record of 3348 bytes. This is repeated until the end of the data set (1725 lines). This database contains both Northern and Southern Hemisphere data. The parameters include latitude, longitude, brightness temperatures at 19, 22, 37, and 85 GHz, and surface type.  \n\n[Reference: Akunuri, R., J. Pritchard, and L.
