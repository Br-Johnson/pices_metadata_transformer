    "description": "Sustainable fisheries require 1) viable stock populations with appropriate harvest limits and 2) appropriate habitat for the fisheries to survive, forage, seek refuge, grow and reproduce.  Unlike some deep-water rocky habitats, those formed from deep-water stands of coral may be vulnerable to fishing disturbance and therefore affect on the fishery may be confounded by simultaneous loss of habitat during fishing effort.  Thus, the rate at which habitat can be restored is a critical aspect of fishery management.  The purpose of this study was to characterize growth rates for a habitat-forming deep-sea coral.  Two nearly complete colonies of red tree coral (Primnoa resedaeformis) collected from off southeast Alaska were used for an analysis of age and growth characteristics.  CAT scans revealed that colonies consisted of multiple settlement events, where older basal structures provide for settlement of new colonies.  The decay of exogenous 210Pb over the length of the colony was used to validate age estimates from growth zone counts.  Age estimates were over 100 yr for sections near the heavily calcified base.  Based on validated growth zone counts, growth of red tree coral ranged from 1.60 to 2.32 cm per year in height and was approximately 0.36 mm per year in diameter.  These growth rates suggest that the fishery habitat created by red tree coral is extremely vulnerable to bottom fishing activities and may take over 100 years to recover.  \n\n [ Co-PIs: Gregor M.
