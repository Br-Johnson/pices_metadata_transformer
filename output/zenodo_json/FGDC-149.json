Information in this\ncollection dates back to the 18th century for daily, monthly, seasonal,\nand annual tabular summaries, and the 19th century for weather maps.\nThese data are the result of foreign exchange agreements, but the\ncollection has not been updated since 1983.\n \nIn these summaries, definitions are:\n\n1.   Hourly/daily/monthly/seasonal/annual data -- values determined for each consecutive period, e.g. monthly temperature data:  January\n     1900, February 1900, etc.\n\n2.  Long-term data -- values determined over a period of years, e.g. long-term monthly temperature data using January 1901,  January 1902,\n     etc.\n \nThis book contains graphs of seawater / freshwater content in the ice vs. temperature, changes in the volumes of the freshwater \nice between 0 deg and -1 deg, volumes of one cubical centimeter of fresh and salt water at different temperatures, hourly \ntemperature-salinity-depth sections,  water color, and  ice along the route of \"Veda\" expedition form Nordkap to Bering Straits\nin 1878.\n\nGraphs contain the following data:  \n\n-volumes of  one cubic centimeter of fresh and salt water Vs state of the ice\n-changes in the volume of the fresh water ice between 0 degrees and -1 degree\n-volumes of one cubical centimeter of fresh and salt water at different temperatures\n\nMaps contain the following data:\n\n-hourly salinity-temperature-depth for August-September\n-daily sea surface temperature and salinity\n-daily sea water color, depth, and ice",
