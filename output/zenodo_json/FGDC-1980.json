    "notes": "Purpose: Author Herman Melville, who immortalized sperm whales in his classic story, Moby Dick, attributed a sinister intelligence to the mysterious animals.\n\nWhat's going on inside those big brains may not be so sinister, but their cleverness is putting some sperm whales on the wrong side of Alaska's longline fishermen, who fish by anchoring miles of baited hooks to the seafloor to catch sablefish, also called black cod. To sperm whales, fish caught on longlines are a seafood buffet, says Jan Straley, a biologist at the University of Alaska Southeast.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: None\n\nUse constraints: None\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
