    "description": "The 3-D finite element North Pacific Circulation Model developed in the Novosibirsk Institute of Computational Mathematics and Mathematical Geophysics (ICMMG) is used to study the sensitivity of the North Pacific circulation to the varying boundary conditions at the sea surface.  The initial conditions were taken from the results of the tree-year spin-up numerical experiment of climate circulation which were carried out on the basis of the climate temperature and salinity data of Levitus, 1994 and the wind-stress of Hellerman, Rosenstein, 1982.",
