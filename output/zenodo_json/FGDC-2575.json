    "description": "A global grid of 'low resolution' land/sea tags is maintained and used both to check AVHRR targets and to determine at which grid points SST field temperatures will be maintained. The resolution of these tags is 28 and 50 km centered on the grid point. The grid spacing is 1/2 degree between 85N and 85S. The file is divided into 3 regions, each two records long with some overlap of regions to minimize the number of reads necessary in target processing. The regions are as follows: 1) 85S-25S, 2) 30S to 30N, and 3) 25N-85N. The polar regions are considered to be perpetually ice-covered and no SST targets in these regions will be processed.",
