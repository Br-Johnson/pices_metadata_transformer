    "description": "In June and July 1980 and again in July and August 1981, the\nU.S. Geological Survey (USGS) conducted reconnaissance surveys\nfrom 171 degrees W to 173 degrees E longitude along the Aleutian\nArc and Trench near the islands of Atka, Amlia, Kiska, Agattu and\nSeguam.  A total of 2880 km of 24-channel seismic-reflection data\nwere collected on the USGS Research Vessel S.P. Lee (USGS cruise\nidentifiers L5-80-AA and L9-81-AA).  These profiles are now\navailable for purchase from the National Geophysical Data Center\n(NGDC).",
