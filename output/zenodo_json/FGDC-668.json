    "description": "Data Type: Exxon Valdez Oil Spill;  This data set documents the 1990 joint pretreatment walking survey of the spill impact area. Exxon was responsible for data collection, entry and quality assurance management for this project. This was the first of a series of joint surveys designed to provide a basis for agreement between the principal parties on the scope of additional work during the 1990 treatment season. Surveys were conducted by teams walking the shoreline and recording observations of surface and subsurface oil conditions. Maps and sketches depicting the location, coverage, and characteristics of the remaining oil were produced. Exxon contracted biologists surveyed intertidal areas. Data is referenced by beach segments and subdivision.",
