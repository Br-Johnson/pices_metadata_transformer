    "description": "Tropical instability waves have been shown to have a major impact on the variability of temperature and nutrients along the equatorial wave guide. In order to assess\nthe impact of these features on carbon species distributions during an ENSO event, sea surface temperature, salinity, sigma-t, nitrate, CO fugacity, total inorganic\ncarbon, total alkalinity, and pH along the equator were measured from 130째W to 100째W during 8-15 May 1992. Concurrent moored measurements of surface\ncurrents and temperature were also made at 0째, 110째W. Results indicate that tropical instability waves, with periods of 15 to 20 days and zonal wavelengths of\n700-800 km, controlled the observed spatial variability of the CO species, nitrate and hydrographic parameters at the equator.",
