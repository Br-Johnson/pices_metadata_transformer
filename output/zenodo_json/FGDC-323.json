    "description": "The assessment of Eastern Bering Sea (EBS)  Walleye Pollock presented to managers has increasingly been sensitive to year-class abundance estimates prior to their availability to the fishery.  The fishery from this region has annually produced an excess of 1 million tons of Pollock for the past two decades.  Data from two surveys proved to be crucial in developing a harvest strategy for 1997 and for projecting the expected fishery impacts in the short term (for 1998 - 2000).",
