    "description": "The IPHC employs port samplers at 18 ports from St. Paul Island (Pribilofs) to Newport (Oregon).  The port samplers collect both fishing log and biological data.  Gathered from the fishing logs are fishing data, time and location as well as fishing effort.  From this data the IPHC is able to continue its 60-year industry catch-per-unit-effort-index.  The landed catches provide size data and otoliths for age composition.  \n\n[ Reference: PICES Scientific Report No. 18 2001, Proceedings of the PICES/CoML/IPRC Workshop on \"Impact of Climate Variability on Observation and Prediction of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes in the North Pacific\", http://www.pices.int/publications/scientific_reports/Report18/default.aspx. ]",
