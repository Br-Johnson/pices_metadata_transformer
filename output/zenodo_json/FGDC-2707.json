    "description": "Oceanographic stations occupied by USCGC GLASCIER in the eastern Chukchi Sea during 25 September - 17 October 1970 revealed that currents and the distributions of physical and chemical variable were strongly influenced by the effects of wind and cooling.  The effects of Alaskan coastal runoff, melting of sea ice, freezing of sea ice and bottom water from the central Bering Strait were observed.",
