    "description": "This model was developed as a mathematical representation of a conceptual model presented in Megrey et al. (1996).  It is a numerical simulation of the recruitment process.  A generalized description of stochastic mortality is formulated as a function of three specific mortality components considered important in controlling survival (random, wind mixing events, and prevalence of oceanic eddies).  The sum total of these, under some conditional dependencies, determines the overall survival experienced by the recruits.  \n\n[ Reference: Megrey, B. A., Hollowed, A. B., Hare, S. R., Macklin, S.
