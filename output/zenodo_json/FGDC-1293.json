    "notes": "Purpose: The newly discovered crabs aren't likely to become dinner favorites anytime soon, since they live out of fishermen's reach some 11,000 feet down in the North Pacific Ocean. Brad Stevens, a crab biologist with the National Marine Fisheries Service in Kodiak, Alaska, found the crabs while exploring the Patton Seamount with the submersible ALVIN, some 250 miles south of Kodiak.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required.\n\nUse constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
