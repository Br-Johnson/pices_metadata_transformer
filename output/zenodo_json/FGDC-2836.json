    "description": "Harbor Porpoises occur regularly in the north Pacific Ocean and the Bering\n     Sea and occasionally in the Chukchi Sea during the ice-free months. Point\n     Barrow, Alaska is considered to be near the northern limit of distribution for\n     this species. We have obtained nine records from the vicinity of Point Barrow\n     between 1985 and 1991. Harbor Porpoises were found entangled in\n     subsistence fishing nets, seen live or found dead on the beach. These records\n     indicate a regular use of the northeastern Chukchi Sea and extreme western\n     Beaufort Sea. The reasons for their occurrence near Point Barrow are\n     unknown but the relative abundance of fish in coastal arctic lagoons may\n     attract Harbor Porpoises northward.",
