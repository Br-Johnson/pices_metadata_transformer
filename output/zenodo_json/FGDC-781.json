    "description": "Data Type: Vegetation/Land Cover/Soils;  Vegetation developed using Alaska Land And Resources Mapping Program (ALARM). Pacific GIS used several different full resolution vegetation datasets organized by 1:250,000 scale USGS quadrangles to cover the Prince William Sound - Copper River ecosystem. This data set, developed by the Alaska Department of Natural Resources (DNR) was created to assist in region wide planning efforts. Pacific GIS developed a cross-walk from the original vegetation codes to the closest equivalent vegetation type in the Alaska Vegetation Classification scheme to provide a common classification that can be used across the ecosystem for various sources of vegetation data. This common classification is included along with the original classification.",
