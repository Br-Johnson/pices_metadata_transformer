    "description": "This report references species composition data of invertebrate species: Clinocardium nuttali, Littorina gronlandica, Littorina rudis, Littorina scutulata, Littorina sitkana, Macoma balthica, Modiolus spp., Mya arenaria, Mytilus trossulus, Protothaca staminea, and Saxidomus giganteus, from the Gulf of Alaska.\n\n  The aforementioned data are referenced in citation: Burch, J. Q.  1945-1946.  Distributional list of west America marine mollusks from San Diego to the Polar sea.  Proc. Conch.  Club. So. CA part 2, 1 (46-54) March - November  1945; 2 (55 to 63) December 1945 to September 1946.\n\n  This literature was collected as part of a metadatabase that represents one or more nearshore resources (from physical attributes such as water and air, to birds and mammals).  Each entry is viewable in three formats, 1) a geospatial explicit format (ArcView 3.3) named GIS ArcView 3.3 Near GEM project, 2) a spreadsheet format (Excel 2002 and within ArcView) named GEM Nearshore Metadata Set, and 3) a ProCite database named GEM Nearshore Metadata References, which consists of references included in 1 and 2 above.  The ProCite database record number corresponds to the Excel Procite Number.  Reference Procite #151 for this literature's metadata.\n\n  The metadata are maintained in digital format (ArcView 3.3, Excel 2002, and Procite) and are available from the Alaska Science Center, USGS in Anchorage, Alaska.\n\n  For a detailed description of the three databases and the project, see \"Bodkin, J. L., and T. Dean.  2003.
