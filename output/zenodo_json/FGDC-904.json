    "description": "In the 2002 season, SECM research was conducted during 30 cruise days using the NOAA ship John N. Cobb over four time periods from May to August.  Thirteen core stations were repetitively sampled each time period, and a total of 5,262 juvenile salmon and 3,329 nonsalmonids were captured in 79 surface trawl hauls.  Associated oceanographic sampling at each station included vertical profiling of the water column to 200 m, surface water sampling for chlorophyll and nutrients, and zooplankton sampling with three types of nets.",

    "notes": "Purpose: Surveys were continued for the sixth consecutive year in support of the Southeast Alaska Coastal Monitoring (SECM) project in 2002.  This project was initiated in 1997 to study the habitat use and early marine ecology of juvenile (age -.0) Pacific salmon.  The SECM research addresses components identified in the NMFS Strategic Plan and the NPAFC 2001-2005 Science Plan.  The goal of the SECM research is to build a time series of data to examine how biophysical parameters affect regional stocks of salmon with respect to habitat use, marine growth, and hatchery-wild stock interactions, and to understand these relationships in conjunction with environmental change, year-class strength of salmon, and coastal marine carrying capacity of salmon.\n\nStatus: In Progress\n\nMaintenance frequency: Unknown\n\nAccess constraints: None\n\nUse constraints: Contact the agency.\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
