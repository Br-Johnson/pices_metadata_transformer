    "description": "Maizuru Marine Observatory of the Japan Meteorological Agency has conducted routine oceanographic research cruises along the PM line for more than 30 years.  PM line oceanographic data set were collected from R.V. Seifu-Maru II-II Ship Observation.  The PM line is based on data taken at three stations; PM4, PM5, and PM6.  Zooplankton data included plankton wet weight, Chaetognath species composition, composition of major zooplankton taxa, and Copepod species and size composition.  The samples were collected between 0-150 m.  \n\n[ Reference: PICES Scientific Report No. 18 2001, Proceedings of the PICES/CoML/IPRC Workshop on \"Impact of Climate Variability on Observation and Prediction of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes in the North Pacific\", http://www.pices.int/publications/scientific_reports/Report18/default.aspx. ]",
