    "description": "This report explores two aspects of the relationship of seal abundance to the activities of man.  The first considers the probable effects of harvest termination on future fur seal abundance via possible direct reduction effects, behavioral effects, food competition and genetic effects.  The second explores the relationship between the present seal population decline on the Pribilof Islands and entanglement in discarded fishery netting and other flotsam.",
