Available indices are:  NAO.IAS; (North American Oscillation Pattern); NP.IAS (North Pacific Pattern); PNA.IAS (Pacific North America Pattern); S_OSC.IAS (Southern Oscillation Index).  SOI index is also available on the IOS WWW server. IOS on-line versions are presently prepared and maintained by Howard Freeland.\n\nPSARC_Utility\nSeveral of these indices have been used in correlation-type studies of production/growth/survival of oceanic fish stocks. The Southern  Oscillation Index is frequently used to detect El Nino conditions and to describe the magnitude of the El Nino event.\n\nImprovements\nAutomate the update process and provide additional file options (IOS Header and or CSV spreadsheet format). Create public directory for these or add them to our INTERNET WWW server site.\n\nBase Internet/URL\nhttp://www.cgd.ucar.edu/\n\nA TCODE project",
