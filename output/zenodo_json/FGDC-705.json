    "description": "Data Type: Infrastructure;   This layer contains detailed road data organized by 1:250,000 scale USGS quadrangles for the Prince William Sound - Copper River ecosystem. Pacific GIS derived this dataset from 1:250,000 scale, 1990 Census TIGER / line file data. Although this dataset is very detailed, problems in spatial accuracy become apparent at large scales.",
