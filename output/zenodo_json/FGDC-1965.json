    "description": "Spotted seals and harbor seals look so much alike that when it comes to telling them apart, even biologists end up scratching their heads. In places like Bristol Bay, where the two species coexist, scientists are turning to DNA for answers. As Doug Schneider reports in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio, being able to tell the difference may help researchers learn more about seals and about how these marine mammals might respond to climate change.",

    "notes": "Purpose: Alaska's Bristol Bay is a place on the edge of two worlds. To the north is the Bering Strait and the icy High Arctic. To the south are the somewhat warmer waters of the North Pacific Ocean. Being on the edge makes Bristol Bay a gathering point for two normally separated species. One is the harbor seal, the plump, ubiquitous marine mammal that prefers ice-free areas; and the spotted seal, a species at home along the ice edge.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: None\n\nUse constraints: None\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
