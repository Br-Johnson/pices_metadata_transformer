    "description": "This report references habitat utilization data of fish species: Anoplarchus purpurescans and Pholis laeta; morphometrics and oil contaminant data of fish species (Anoplarchus purpurescans); population abundance and production data of algal species (Fucus gardneri), fish species: Anoplarchus purpurescans and Pholis laeta, invertebrate communities, and invertebrate species: Littorina scutulata, Littorina sitkana, Littorina spp., Lottia pelta, Mytilus trossulus, and Tectura persona; shoreline geomorphological type data of sediment; species composition data of invertebrate communities and invertebrate species: Dermasterias imbricata, Evasterias troschelii, Pisaster ochraceus, Pycnopodia helianthoides, and Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis; and survival data of fish species (Anoplarchus purpurescans) from Cook Inlet, Kodiak Island, and Prince William Sound, Alaska.\n\n  The aforementioned data are referenced in citation: Highsmith, R. C., M. S. Stekoll, W. E. Barber, L. McDonald, D. Strickland, and W. P. Erickson.  Comprehensive assessment of coastal habitat.     Exxon Valdez oil spill state/federal natural resource damage assessment. Final report of Coastal Habitat Study. Volumes  I-VII.\n\n  This literature was collected as part of a metadatabase that represents one or more nearshore resources (from physical attributes such as water and air, to birds and mammals).  Each entry is viewable in three formats, 1) a geospatial explicit format (ArcView 3.3) named GIS ArcView 3.3 Near GEM project, 2) a spreadsheet format (Excel 2002 and within ArcView) named GEM Nearshore Metadata Set, and 3) a ProCite database named GEM Nearshore Metadata References, which consists of references included in 1 and 2 above.  The ProCite database record number corresponds to the Excel Procite Number.  Reference Procite #456 for this literature's metadata.\n\n  The metadata are maintained in digital format (ArcView 3.3, Excel 2002, and Procite) and are available from the Alaska Science Center, USGS in Anchorage, Alaska.\n\n  For a detailed description of the three databases and the project, see \"Bodkin, J. L., and T. Dean.  2003.  Alternative Sampling Designs for Nearshore Monitoring (Gulf Ecosystem Monitoring and Research Project G-030687), US Geological Survey, Alaska Science Center, Anchorage, Alaska.\" available on-line at http://www.evostc.state.ak.us/pdf/GEM_final_reports/030687.pdf.",
