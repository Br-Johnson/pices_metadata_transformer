    "description": "Data Type: Exxon Valdez Oil Spill;  This dataset is an integration of three major oil spill database themes, shoreline oiling, environmental sensitivity index and land status processed in order to provide regional totals for the spill affected coastline. This integrated coverage indicates the change of oil over time and is queriable by ESI code or land status. The use of this integrated coverage is to provide numerical data for use in damage assessment process.",
