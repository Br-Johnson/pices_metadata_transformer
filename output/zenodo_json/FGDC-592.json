    "description": "Data Type: Base Maps;  This layer contains the boundaries of the 1:63,360 scale USGS quadrangles within the Prince William Sound - Copper River ecosystem. Pacific GIS derived this layer from data obtained from the USGS EROS Alaska Field Office. Additional grid data layers covering the Prince William Sound - Copper River ecosystem include a 1:250,000 scale USGS quadrangle coverage (QUAD.250), a latitude and longitude coverage (LAT/LONG.250) a township boundary coverage (TOWNSHIP.250), and a section boundary coverage (SECTIONS.250).",
