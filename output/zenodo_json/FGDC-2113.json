    "description": "This book references diversity and oil contaminant data of nearshore bird communities and  population abundance data of black oystercatchers (Haematopus bachmani), goldeneyes (Bucephala islandica), harlequin ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus), and scoters (Melanitta spp.) from Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound, Alaska.\n\n  The aforementioned data are referenced in citation: Day, R. H., S. M. Murphy, J. A. Wiens, G. D. Hayward, E. J. Harner, and L. N. Smith.  1995.  Use of oil-affected habitats by birds after the Exxon Valdez oil spill.  In Exxon Valdez oil spill: Fate and effects in Alaskan waters.  ASTM STP 1219.  Philadelphia, PA: American Society for Testing and Materials.  pp. 726-761.\n\n  This literature was collected as part of a metadatabase that represents one or more nearshore resources (from physical attributes such as water and air, to birds and mammals).  Each entry is viewable in three formats, 1) a geospatial explicit format (ArcView 3.3) named GIS ArcView 3.3 Near GEM project, 2) a spreadsheet format (Excel 2002 and within ArcView) named GEM Nearshore Metadata Set, and 3) a ProCite database named GEM Nearshore Metadata References, which consists of references included in 1 and 2 above.  The ProCite database record number corresponds to the Excel Procite Number.  Reference Procite #225 for this literature's metadata.\n\n  The metadata are maintained in digital format (ArcView 3.3, Excel 2002, and Procite) and are available from the Alaska Science Center, USGS in Anchorage, Alaska.\n\n  For a detailed description of the three databases and the project, see \"Bodkin, J. L., and T. Dean.  2003.  Alternative Sampling Designs for Nearshore Monitoring (Gulf Ecosystem Monitoring and Research Project G-030687), US Geological Survey, Alaska Science Center, Anchorage, Alaska.\" available on-line at http://www.evostc.state.ak.us/pdf/GEM_final_reports/030687.pdf.",
