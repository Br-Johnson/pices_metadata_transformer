    "description": "As consumers, many of us want to know that the products we buy won't harm the environment or us. That's especially important when it comes to seafood, since much of the seafood we eat still comes from the ocean. A labeling program that lets consumers know if the fish they eat comes from well-managed stocks is having an impact in Alaska. As Doug Schneider reports in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio, one Alaska fishery has met the program's certification standards, but another faces opposition from environmentalists.",

    "notes": "Purpose: Some people might remember the controversy more than a decade ago over dolphins killed by tuna fishermen in the South Pacific Ocean. The flap ended only after the industry agreed to fishing methods that reduced dolphin deaths. As an incentive, companies that sold tuna caught with such methods could market the catch as dolphin safe. Such labeling was a hit among consumers and launched an era of so-called \"green\" labeling. \n\n More recently, Alaska seafood has gotten in on the trend. \n\nIn December, Alaska salmon became the first U.S. fishery certified as environmentally friendly by the Marine Stewardship Council, a nonprofit organization that uses green labeling as a way to improve fisheries management. Jim Humphreys is the U.S. director of the Marine Stewardship Council.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required.\n\nUse constraints: Acknowledgement of data source publication required\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
