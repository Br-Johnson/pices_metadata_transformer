    "description": "The commercial and research data collected are input to a complex size, sex and age structured model.  The model produces estimates from 1974 to the present) of exploitable biomass, exploitation rates, fishing mortality, annual surplus production and recruitment.  Estimates of recruitment and exploitable biomass prior to 1974 are available from a VPA type analysis.  \n\n[ Reference: PICES Scientific Report No. 18 2001, Proceedings of the PICES/CoML/IPRC Workshop on \"Impact of Climate Variability on Observation and Prediction of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes in the North Pacific\", http://www.pices.int/publications/scientific_reports/Report18/default.aspx. ]",
