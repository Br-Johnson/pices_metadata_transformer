    "description": "A dynamic-thermodynamic sea ice model is developed and coupled with\n     the Melbourne University general circulation model to simulate the seasonal\n     cycle of the Antarctic sea ice distribution. The model is efficient, rapid to\n     compute, and useful for a range of climate studies. The thermodynamic part\n     of the sea ice model is similar to that developed by Parkinson and\n     Washington, the dynamics contain a simplified ice rheology that resists\n     compression. The thermodynamics is based on energy conservation at the top\n     surface of the ice/snow, the ice/water interface, and the open water area to\n     determine the ice formation, accretion, and ablation. A lead parameterization\n     is introduced with an effective partitioning scheme for freezing between and\n     under the ice floes. The dynamic calculation determines the motion of ice,\n     which is forced with the atmospheric wind, taking account of ice resistance\n     and rafting. The simulated sea ice distribution compares reasonably well with\n     observations. The seasonal cycle of ice extent is well simulated in phase as\n     well as in magnitude. Simulated sea ice thickness and concentration are also\n     in good agreement with observations over most regions and serve to indicate\n     the importance of advection and ocean drift in the determination of the sea ice\n     distribution.",
