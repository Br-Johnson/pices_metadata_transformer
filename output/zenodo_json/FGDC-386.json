    "description": "Characteristics of the physical environment which vary over time scales from annual to decadal are examined in terms of their role in the ecosystem of the Bering Sea.  The features examined are: solar activity, the lunar nodal cycle of the moon, atmospheric circulation, ice cover, transport from the Pacific Ocean and shelf circulation.  The characteristics of the physical environment that are expected to respond to greenhouse gas-induced climate change are presented and their potential influence on the ecosystem discussed.  We conclude by presenting a set of central issues and questions regarding how the Bering Sea functions.",
