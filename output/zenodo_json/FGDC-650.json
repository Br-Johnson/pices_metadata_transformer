    "description": "Data Type: Exxon Valdez Oil Spill;  This dataset digitally depicts the Exxon beach segment numbering system used to link work performed on beaches for the official record during the EVOS cleanup. Segments are divided into subsegments. This segmentation system was used as the geographic base for many response databases. This data was used to provide a standardized geographic base from which the response team could track oil spill cleanup activities.",
