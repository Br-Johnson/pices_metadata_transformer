Also includes a report of MODEL Task Team meetings at the end of the workshop and just prior to the fifth Annual PICES meeting, in which the workshop results are distilled into a plan for action regarding the Climate Change and Carrying Capacity (CCCC) modeling activities.  Summaries of the Japan-GLOBEC symposium and reports of national GLOBEC activities in member nations are included as appendices.\n\n   [ LC Call No. GC781 .P535 no.7.  ISBN 0969842074 ]",
