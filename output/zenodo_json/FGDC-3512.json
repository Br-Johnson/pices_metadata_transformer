    "description": "The parameters in this data set are level temperatures, brightness temperatures and radiosonde profiles. The radiosonde profiles and the temperature retrievals from F12 are matched in space and time. The spacecraft F12 data resides in a rotating file at the Office of Satellite Data Processing and Distribution (OSDPD) in Suitland, Maryland. The historical data for F12 also resides at OSDPD.",
