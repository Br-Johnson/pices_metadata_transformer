    "description": "This data set contains one SST image for each computation: split window, dual window, and triple window for Multichannel SST, Cross Product SST, and Non-Linear SST. The data control blocks of the SST file are not fixed, but are determined by the size of the geographic region and the specific subsampling. Each SST image is preceded by one header record. Data word 25 of the header record indicates the SST type that each image represents.\n\n  The Office of Satellite Data Processing and Distribution (OSDPC) keeps this data for a month, then sends it to the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) for archiving.  For current data, contact John Sapper at OSDPC,  telephone 301-457-0914 ext.148, e-mail: john.sapper@noaa.gov.  For archived data contact Thomas Ross at NCDC, telephone 828-271-4499, e-mail: tom.ross@noaa.gov.",
