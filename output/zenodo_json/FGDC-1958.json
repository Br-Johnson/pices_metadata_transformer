    "description": "Steller sea lion populations in western Alaska have declined by some 80 percent since the 1960s. Scientists trying to understand why believe the sea mammals may not be getting enough fish to eat. To test the theory, one scientist first had to get the sea lions to open wide and say ahhh. Doug Schneider has more in this week?s Arctic Science Journeys Radio.",

    "notes": "Purpose: Russ Andrews studies animals that live mostly out of view to people. Animals like sea lions and elephant seals dive too deep for scientists to follow. To learn more about them, he needed special instruments that monitor their activities. Such instruments are available for land animals, but not for animals that dive hundreds, even thousands, of feet deep in the ocean. So, Andrews taught himself a bit about electronics and set to work building the instruments he needed; soldering together bits of wire, computer chips and circuit boards.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: None\n\nUse constraints: None\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
