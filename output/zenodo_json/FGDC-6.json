    "description": "Bristol Bay is considered a nursery area for Pacific halibut and was closed to\n     commercial halibut fishing from 1967 to 1989. In the summer of 1987 the\n     International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) conducted a survey in\n     Bristol Bay to assess the commercial stock size of halibut and the incidence of\n     sublegal fish. Three vessels fished the coastal area from Cape Newenham to\n     Cape Seniavin. The catch per unit effort was 6 pounds, well below the catch\n     per unit effort observed in other areas of the Bering Sea. The catch of\n     sublegal halibut was low; less than 0.5 halibut per unit effort. The survey\n     results suggested that a limited commercial fishery in Bristol Bay would not\n     have an adverse impact on juvenile stocks. The IPHC extended the regulatory\n     Area 4E boundary to allow commercial fishing in Bristol Bay in 1990. Fishing\n     success has been poor compared to other areas and the number of vessels\n     reporting landings in the fishery decreased from 97 in 1990 to 19 in 1992.\n     Annual Bristol Bay catches have ranged from 14,000 to 26,000 pounds.",
