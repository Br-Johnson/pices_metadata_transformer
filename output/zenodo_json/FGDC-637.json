    "description": "Data Type: Elevation;  This layer is a composite, merged and generalized shaded relief image organized by 1:250,000 scale USGS quadrangles within the Prince William Sound - Copper River ecosystem. Pacific GIS derived this shaded relief layer from elevation data which is based on digital elevation model (DEM) data at 1:250,000 scale acquired from the USGS EROS Alaska Field Office. The shading is a mathematically calculated value to provide the illusion of a terrain surface being illuminated by an implied light source. It is useful as a back- drop for other data because it gives an intuitive view of the landscape.",
