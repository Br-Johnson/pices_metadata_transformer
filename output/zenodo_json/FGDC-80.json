    "description": "DMSP F11 monthly averaged sea ice concentration grids in the polar \nstereographic projection are produced based on daily sea ice concentration \ngrids generated using the NASA Team algorithm. Processing is continuous \nbeginning 3 December 1991,  and continues the series begun with F8 monthly \naveraged data. Although a high degree of correlation exists between F8 and F11 \ndata (Abdalati et al. 1995), regression coefficients (NSIDC 1995) have been \napplied in deriving F11 daily ice concentrations, which form the basis for \nthis data set. Monthly averaged data files contain ice concentration in \npercent ranging from 0% to 100%. Then, ice concentrations are delineated \nusing 0%, 5%, 10% and 15% as the minimum concentrations included in the \naverages (e.g.: a 5% cutoff sets all data values between 1% and 5% to 0%). \nThese four thresholds accommodate as many potential applications as possible. \nGrids are 8-bit raster images stored in HDF.  Data in compressed tar files are \ndistributed via ftp, on sidads.colorado.edu (IP address 128.138.135.20).",
