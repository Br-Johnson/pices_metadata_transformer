    "description": "Data for the IPHC ocean bottom properties database were assembled from several sources, including the National Oceanic Data Center, National Marine Fisheries Service, Japanese Meteorological Agency, U.S. Foreign Observer Program, University of Alaska, and IPHC longline surveys.  The data were quality controlled through comparison of means and variances in areas of overlap.  All data were plotted and depths were checked against an independent bathymetry database (TerrainBase).  The database has the following boundary conditions: - Areal coverage: Alaska, British Columbia, and U.S. West Coast (to 30N) shelf and upper slope; - Depth: observations must be within 15 m of the bottom and are restricted to areas with a bottom depth of 1,000 m or less; - Variables: temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, nutrients (phosphate, nitrate, nitrite); - Time: as complete a historical record as possible.  Most of the data were compiled in the months of May through September.  \n\n[ Reference: PICES Scientific Report No. 18 2001, Proceedings of the PICES/CoML/IPRC Workshop on \"Impact of Climate Variability on Observation and Prediction of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes in the North Pacific\", http://www.pices.int/publications/scientific_reports/Report18/default.aspx. ]",
