    "description": "Subsurface mooring data from the Bering Sea: Station Inner Front 5.  Data were collected from 1994 through 2004.  Sampled months varied through the years but were usually during April and June.  Salinity, temperature, and UV vector data were collected at various depths throughout the years using instruments such as MTR, RCM-4, RCM-7, and RCM-9.  50m was the maximum bottom depth.",
