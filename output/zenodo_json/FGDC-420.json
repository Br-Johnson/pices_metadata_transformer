    "description": "The presence of a variety of contaminants has been reported in environmental samples of the eastern Bering Sea. The contaminant of greatest concern is mercury (Hg), in light of the high levels of this element reported in some marine sediments and organisms of the sea and contiguous fluvial estuaries. We hypothesize that several unique environmental conditions, coupled with high natural supply of terrigenous Hg, result in high bioaccumulation of this element in marine organisms of the Bering Sea region with ultimate potential risk to commercial and subsistence users.  The primary objective of the study is to check whether the concentrations of Hg in some commercial and subsistence organisms in the Bering Sea are at levels that pose a risk to the organisms and are unacceptable for human consumption. To fulfill this objective we will analyze the concentrations of total Hg [Hg(t)] and its more toxic form, methylmercury (MeHg), in\nselected commercial and subsistence organisms of the Bering Sea (salmon, king crab, and clams). This study deals with issues considered a high priority by the Bering Sea Marine Research Plan (1998) as well as by several state and federal agencies and Bering Sea native groups.\n\nThis project also includes;\n\nJohn Kelley \nSchool of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences\n245 O'Neill Building\nUniversity of Alaska Fairbanks\nFairbanks, AK 99775-7220\n\nAn NPMR project",
