    "description": "Contains digital satellite data from the satellites NOAA, Landsat 1-5, and SPOT.  The ground truth data/field data are vegetation (reliefs) data, geomorphology, air pollution impact data (long transported/locally), and sea temperature.  Atmospheric physics data are ozone data (satellite and ground measurements).  Also included are Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data (aircraft, buoys).",
