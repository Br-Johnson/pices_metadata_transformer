Where applicable, entries are cross-referenced by specific research project or National Oceanographic Data Center cruise track number.  The most recent version of the database is available as a Corel Paradox database table and Adobe Acrobat documents.  The area of interest is bounded by the western Alaska coast to Point Barrow (155 W longitude) and eastern Russia coast to Wrangel Island (182 E lognitude), Aleutian Islands in the south (51 latitude) and approximately 75 N latitude in the north.
