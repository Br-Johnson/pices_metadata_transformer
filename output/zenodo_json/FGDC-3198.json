    "description": "This report references population abundance data of black oystercatchers (Haematopus bachmani), scoters (Melanitta spp.), sea otters (Enhydra lutris), and nearshore bird communities; production data of nearshore bird communities; and species composition data of black oystercatchers (Haematopus bachmani), goldeneyes (Bucephala islandica), harlequin ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus), scoters (Melanitta spp.), and nearshore bird communities from Constantine Harbor, Prince William Sound, Alaska.\n\n  The aforementioned data are referenced in citation: Kane, N.M. and Boyd, D.K.  1979.  A population study of seabirds, shorebirds, and waterfowl associated with Constantine Harbor, Hinchinbrook Island, Prince William Sound, 1978.  U.S. Fish and Wildl. Serv., Off. Spec. Stud., Anchorage, Alaska.\n\n  This literature was collected as part of a metadatabase that represents one or more nearshore resources (from physical attributes such as water and air, to birds and mammals).  Each entry is viewable in three formats, 1) a geospatial explicit format (ArcView 3.3) named GIS ArcView 3.3 Near GEM project, 2) a spreadsheet format (Excel 2002 and within ArcView) named GEM Nearshore Metadata Set, and 3) a ProCite database named GEM Nearshore Metadata References, which consists of references included in 1 and 2 above.  The ProCite database record number corresponds to the Excel Procite Number.  Reference Procite #526 for this literature's metadata.\n\n  The metadata are maintained in digital format (ArcView 3.3, Excel 2002, and Procite) and are available from the Alaska Science Center, USGS in Anchorage, Alaska.\n\n  For a detailed description of the three databases and the project, see \"Bodkin, J. L., and T. Dean.  2003.
