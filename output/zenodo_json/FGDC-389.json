    "description": "The results of studies are presented on the horizontal and vertical distribution of particulate and dissolved organic matter (OM) in the western Bering Sea and Anadyr Bay in June 1992 and July 1993.  The concentrations of dissolved organic forms of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus were in the range of 1.5-6.0 mg/L, 0.017-0.504 mg/L and 0-0.056 mg/L, respectively.",
