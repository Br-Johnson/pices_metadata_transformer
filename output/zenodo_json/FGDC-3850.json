    "description": "The purpose of this project was to contribute to national baseline data on benthic habitat and provide seagrass distribution data to local resource managers. Of particular concern in this study was the distribution of the seagrass, Zostera japonica, on the intertidal mudflats and the expansion of Spartina alterniflora, a threat to a thriving local oyster fishery. The black brant, an endangered migratory waterfowl, is dependent on healthy seagrass beds as a food resource. In addition, salmon has high recreational and commercial value and is also dependent on healthy seagrass beds.",
