    "description": "An eddy-resolving primitive equation model was used to simulate circulation on the shelf in the western Gulf of Alaska. This paper\ndescribes the development and sensitivity analysis of the model, while a companion paper [Stabeno and Hermann, this issue]\ndemonstrates correspondence with measured currents in specific years. The model is initialized with a salinity field derived from local\nconductivity-temperature-depth surveys and forced with an idealized alongshore wind stress pattern. Buoyancy forcing is achieved by\nfreshening the salinity field along a portion of the coastal wall. The model exhibits many of the patterns evident in observations, including\nmean flows and mesoscale eddies associated with the Alaska Coastal Current (ACC). Sensitivity studies suggest a strong dependence of\nthe barotropic flux of the ACC on local winds and weak dependence on upstream buoyancy forcing. Both wind and buoyancy forcing\nsignificantly affect the generation of eddies. Strong northeasterly winds enhance cross-shelf flow of the ACC to the west of Shelikof Strait,\nwhere isobaths veer southward. Strong buoyancy forcing also favors cross-shelf flow in that region and enhances the formation of eddies.",
