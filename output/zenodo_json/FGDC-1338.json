    "description": "Processed moored buoy data. These data contain hourly and daily mean values of air temperature, sea temperature, surface atmospheric pressure, wind speed, and wind direction. Sources of the data are 22 different NOAA NDBC moored buoys along the North American west coast. The data have been processed from the raw hourly data files which makes the data much more user friendly. The processed buoy data is updated semi-annually by PFEL.",
