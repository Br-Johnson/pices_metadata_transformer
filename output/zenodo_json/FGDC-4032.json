    "description": "During the period of the Argo project, approximately 3,000 Argo profiling floats (profiling devices) will be deployed into the world ocean with average spacing of about 300km. The aim of the project is to build a real time, high resolution monitoring system for upper and middle layers of the world ocean, which will Argo floats, satellite communication systems, and information processing technologies. The ocean monitoring system will enable us to obtain the high quality data of upper and middle layers of the world ocean almost simultaneously with very high space-time resolution. That will help us to understand large scale, on going oceanic variations. We are hoping that it will bring in a substantial improvement in the performance of long-term weather forecast. The monitoring system will greatly contribute to the study of interannual, decadal and interdecadal variations of the climate system.",
