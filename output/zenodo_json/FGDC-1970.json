    "description": "If you want to see whales, and I mean a lot of whales, one of the best places to be this summer is in Alaska's Glacier Bay National Park. Here, dozens of humpback whales arrive each summer to feast on schools of pollock, herring and other fish. As Doug Schneider reports in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio, one scientist has the enviable job of keeping track of the park's largest visitors.",

    "notes": "Purpose: Janet Doherty has a life many people would envy. As a biological technician with the National Park Service, she spends her days in a small open boat in Alaska's Glacier Bay National Park. There she keeps watch on humpback whales as they swim, feed and sometimes leap into the air. With at least 60 whales identified in the park this summer, Doherty says the whale watching has been especially good.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: None\n\nUse constraints: None\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
