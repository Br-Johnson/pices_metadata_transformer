    "description": "Ships plying the world's oceans sometimes have unwanted hitchhikers lurking inside their ballast tanks. When the tanks are emptied at distant ports, the marine hitchhikers can displace local marine species. Earlier this year, the federal government mandated that each state begin to deal with the problem. Recently, an Alaska oil tanker became a test-bed for a new technology aimed at killing these invasive species before they can cause harm. Doug Schneider has more, in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio.",

    "notes": "Purpose: The oil supertanker Tonsina is an imposing 869 feet long. When full, it carries more than 807,000 barrels of Alaska crude oil within its double hull to ports along the United States West Coast. The ship also has massive seawater ballast tanks that help stabilize the ship in rough seas. When the ship reaches its destination, the seawater is emptied into local waters.\n\nBut all too often, it's not just seawater that's pumped back into the ocean. Bacteria, viruses, and non-native crabs, mussels and fish are also released. When these foreign species end up in local waters, they can wreak havoc on the marine environment.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: None\n\nUse constraints: None\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
