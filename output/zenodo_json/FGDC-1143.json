    "description": "The CoAxial segment (Juan de Fuca Ridge) was the site of an intense swarm of earthquakes that began at 21:43 GMT on June 26, 1993 (Julian Day 177). The\nswarm started near 46°15N and migrated northward over the next 40 hours to ~46°36N, where the majority of 676 events occurred during the following 3 weeks\nof activity. The earthquakes propagated NNE at a velocity of 0.3 ﾱ 0.1 m s from the southern to northern swarm sites. The activity went undetected by land-based\nseismic networks along the Oregon and Washington coasts, suggesting that the earthquakes were all M  4.0. The character of this earthquake swarm is very similar\nto dike injections observed at Krafla and Kilauea Volcanoes. The earthquake activity and subsequent migration probably represent a lateral dike injection into faults\nand fissures comprising the CoAxial segment. The reservoir acting as the dike's source likely resides beneath, or to the south of, the initial southern swarm of\nearthquakes. The large magma supply at Axial Volcano cannot be ruled out as the source for the CoAxial dike, even though Axial Volcano exhibited no earthquake\nactivity related to the CoAxial swarm. The T-wave earthquake swarm reported here is the first deep-ocean observation of volcanic seismicity associated with what\nmost likely was a mid-ocean ridge dike injection event.",
