    "description": "The eastern Bering Sea shelf supports a large biomass of several Groundfish populations, particularly walleye Pollock.  The main trophic interactions between dominant Groundfish populations in this region involve walleye Pollock as prey.  A multispecies virtual population analysis model (MSVPA) has been parameterized for the eastern Bering Sea in order to move closer to providing multispecies management advice for this region.  The MSVPA model currently includes the following species as predators: walleye Pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus), Greenland turbot (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), yellowfin sole (Pleuronectes asper), arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias), and northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus). Arrowtooth flounder and northern fur seals are entered as Another predators@, which means that population and mortality estimates are not directly made for these species.  Estimates of their consumption rates, diet, and population\nabundance are input, h\n\nA SEBSCC project",
