    "description": "Results of studies in the western Bering Sea during 1990-1993 are presented for different forms or organic nitrogen, ammonium and urea and nitrates, including those for which little is known.  The principal trends for urea distribution in summer are discusses.  Dissolved organic nitrogen made up 65-95% of the total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) at the shelf and shelf break, while it was 15-30% in open surface waters free of a phytoplankton bloom, and decline to 5-15% with depth.  In summer, the shelf and shelf break were characterized by a high content of urea and ammonium (3.0-4.0 uM) while nitrates were below 1.0 uM in the surface layer.  Primary production relied on recycling of labile forms of nitrogen.",
