    "description": "Observations began in the late 1970s to early 1980s after the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) were established.  Data were collected in the Russian EEZ on commercially valuable species.  The main method for collecting data was the trawl survey.  Stations were arranged in transects and covered the area of interest.  Four different time-series surveys were conducted in pelagic layer in Pacific waters according to ecosystem studying program.  Observed regions includes the western Bering Sea, waters off eastern Kamchatka, Pacific waters off Kuril Islands, and the Sea of Okhotsk from 1984 to 2000 with 72 total number of surveys.",
