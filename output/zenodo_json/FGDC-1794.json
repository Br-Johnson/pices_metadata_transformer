    "description": "Fish eggs and larvae and zooplankton were sampled along 15-20 transect lines off the southern Washington and Oregon coasts, from 2 to 100 miles from shore during July 1994 and 1995, June 1996, and July 1997 and 1998.  Plankton sampling was done with a 25 cm CalVET net fitted with 150 Âµm mesh nets.  CTD casts to 70 m were done and nutrient and chlorophyll samples were collected from 3 m depth at each station.   \n\n[ Reference: PICES Scientific Report No. 18 2001, Proceedings of the PICES/CoML/IPRC Workshop on \"Impact of Climate Variability on Observation and Prediction of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes in the North Pacific\", http://www.pices.int/publications/scientific_reports/Report18/default.aspx. ]",
