    "description": "Monthly means in 1-degree lat/lon squares of sea surface temperature and anomalies are posted on LAS (Live Access Server http://www.pfeg.noaa.gov/products/las.html) and as monthly anomaly maps (http://www.pfeg.noaa.gov/products/PFEL/observed/GTS_surface/sfc_temp_maps.html). Data are computed from GTS surface observations received twice a day by PFEL from  FNMOC (Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center http://www.fnmoc.navy.mil). These are global real-time surface observations from platforms such as ships and buoys (both fixed and drifting). They are a subset of the data which will be included in an update to COADS (Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set) (http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/coads/). Also see COADS on CD-ROM (http://www.pfeg.noaa.gov/products/Aux_Data_holdings/COADS/coads.html).\n\nThe following variables are available: 1) Raw 1 degree SST Monthly Mean. 2) Trimmed 1-degree SST Monthly Mean. 3) Raw Number of SST Observations. 4) Trimmed Number of SST Observations. 5) Climatological mean SST. 6) Climatological mean SST Standard Deviation. 7) Monthly SST anomaly. 8) Number of Observations Trimmed based on climatology. 9) Number of Observations Trimmed based on Observations.  \nNote that these are observational data. No analysis has been performed on the data other than the averaging and trimming.\n\nURL -- ( http://www.pfeg.noaa.gov/products/PFEL/observed/GTS_surface/sfc_temp.html )\n\n\n[ Reference: PICES Scientific Report No. 18 2001, Proceedings of the PICES/CoML/IPRC Workshop on \"Impact of Climate Variability on Observation and Prediction of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes in the North Pacific\", http://www.pices.int/publications/scientific_reports/Report18/default.aspx. ]",
