    "description": "This tape contains a half month archive of 1 X 1 degree satellite-derived SST fields between 70S and 70N. The tape is produced on the 2nd and the 16th of each month and contains daily fields for the previous 20 days.\n\nThe tape is a 9-track, 1600 bpi, unlabeled, odd-parity, binary tape produced on an IBM 360/195 computer. The tape has two physical files, each ending with a physical end-of-file mark. The first file has only one record (physical) which\ncontains information about the data on the tape and serves as a header file. The second file has 2851 physical records. The first record is a directory record pointing to each of twenty individual fields. Each field has 142 records.\n   \nThe Office of Satellite Data Processing and Distribution (OSDPC) keeps this data for a half-month, then sends it to the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) for archiving.  For current data, contact John Sapper at OSDPC,  telephone 301-457-0914 ext.148, e-mail: john.sapper@noaa.gov.  For archived data contact Thomas Ross at NCDC, telephone 828-271-4499, e-mail: tom.ross@noaa.gov.",
