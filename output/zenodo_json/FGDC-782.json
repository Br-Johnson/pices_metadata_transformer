    "description": "Data Type: Vegetation/Land Cover/Soils;  Pacific GIS used several different full resolution vegetation datasets organized by 1:250,000 scale USGS quadrangles to cover the Prince William Sound - Copper River ecosystem. The USGS EROS Alaska Field Office developed the Interim Land Cover dataset which is based on Landsat Multispectral Sensor (MSS) satellite imagery with an original resolution of 80 meters. Pacific GIS developed a cross-walk from the interim land cover vegetation types to the closest equivalent vegetation type in the Alaska Vegetation Classification scheme to provide a common classification that can be used across the ecosystem for various sources of vegetation data. This common classification has been added to the original classification information.",
