    "description": "Parameter\nsurface and subsurface currents\n\nMeasurement Details\nsurface currents (almost all from ship drift, plus some GEK data)- includes summaries by area by month; subsurface data  (1972-1992) are from SOFAR, RAFOS and ALACE neutrally buoyant floats and are mostly from the North Atlantic.\n\nPSARC_Utility\n\"Limited potential use \"\"as is\"\". Potentially, data could be summarized in sub-regions and compared with recent measurements to detect anomalies in open ocean circulation patterns.  These data could also be used to validate circulation models\"\n\nImprovements\nnothing appropriate at this time\n\nBase Internet/URL\nhttp://www.nodc.noaa.gov\n\nA TCODE project",
