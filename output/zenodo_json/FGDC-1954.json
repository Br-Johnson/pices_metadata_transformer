    "description": "For the past decade, scientists have searched for the cause of the dramatic decline of Steller sea lions in Alaska. Now they're focusing on the role of killer whales. But with so little known about these cunning ocean predators, scientists are asking the public for help. Doug Schneider has more, in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio.",

    "notes": "Purpose: Scientists have studied almost every possible cause for the disappearance of nearly 80 percent of the endangered Steller sea lions that inhabit the Aleutian Islands and western Gulf of Alaska. And while some sort of problem with their food supply remains high on the list of suspects, researchers now are turning their attention to orcas, more commonly known as killer whales. Andrew Trites is a sea lion researcher at the University of British Columbia and director of the North Pacific Universities Marine Mammal Consortium in Vancouver.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: None Planned\n\nAccess constraints: None\n\nUse constraints: None\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
