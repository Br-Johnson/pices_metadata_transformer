    "description": "This modeling effort (the 3-D NPZ model coupled with a physical model of the circulation of the region) is designed to test hypotheses regarding the effect of climate change/regime shifts on production in the coastal region of the Gulf of Alaska, including effects on cross-shelf transport, upstream effects, local production, and effect on suitability of the region as habitat for juvenile salmon.  Model spans over the coast Gulf of Alaska water column (0-100 m) from Dixon Entrance to Unimak Pass, 100 m of water column over depths <2000m 5 m depth bins x 20 km horizontal grid.  Model inputs include irradiance, MLD, temperature, diffusivity, bottom depths, and water velocities.  Outputs are diffusivity, ammonium, nitrate, detritus, small and large phytoplankton, dinoflagellates, tintinnids, small coastal copepods, neocalanus and euphausiids.\n\n[ Reference: PICES Scientific Report No. 18 2001, Proceedings of the PICES/CoML/IPRC Workshop on \"Impact of Climate Variability on Observation and Prediction of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes in the North Pacific\", http://www.pices.int/publications/scientific_reports/Report18/default.aspx. ]",
