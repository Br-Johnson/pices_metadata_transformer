    "description": "This report references population abundance data of sea otters (Enhydra lutris) and population abundance and species composition data of algal species: Alaria spp., Fucus distichus, Laminaria spp., and Nereocystis luetkeana; black oystercatchers (Haematopus bachmani); fish species: Ammodytes hexapterus, Hexagrammos decagrammus, and Hexagrammos spp.; goldeneyes (Bucephala islandica); harlequin ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus); and invertebrate species: Clinocardium spp., Dermasterias imbricata, Evasterias troschelii, Macoma spp., Modiolus modiolus, Mya spp., Mytilus trossulus, Pisaster ochraceus, Protothaca staminea, Pycnopodia helianthoides, Saxidomus giganteus, Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis, and Telmessus cheiragonus, from Latouche Point, MacLeod Harbor, and Zaikof Bay, Prince William Sound, Alaska.\n\n  The aforementioned data are referenced in citation: Dames & Moore.  1976.  An ecological assessment of sublittoral plant communities in the northern Gulf of Alaska for NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service.  In Quarterly Report April 1 - June 30, 1976, Outer Continental Shelf Energy Assessment Program.  p. 572-713.\n\n  This literature was collected as part of a metadatabase that represents one or more nearshore resources (from physical attributes such as water and air, to birds and mammals).  Each entry is viewable in three formats, 1) a geospatial explicit format (ArcView 3.3) named GIS ArcView 3.3 Near GEM project, 2) a spreadsheet format (Excel 2002 and within ArcView) named GEM Nearshore Metadata Set, and 3) a ProCite database named GEM Nearshore Metadata References, which consists of references included in 1 and 2 above.  The ProCite database record number corresponds to the Excel Procite Number.  Reference Procite #212 for this literature's metadata.\n\n  The metadata are maintained in digital format (ArcView 3.3, Excel 2002, and Procite) and are available from the Alaska Science Center, USGS in Anchorage, Alaska.\n\n  For a detailed description of the three databases and the project, see \"Bodkin, J. L., and T. Dean.  2003.
