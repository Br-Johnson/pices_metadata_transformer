Of the 22 regional species here recorded, the 11 species (50%) are new to science: Pontharpiniinae: Mandibulophoxus mayi, new species; M. alaskensis, new species; Brolginae: Paraphoxus rugosus new species, P. pacificus, new species, P. communis, new species, P. gracilis, new species, and P. similis, new species; Phoxocephalinae: Parametaphoxus quaylei, new species; Harpiniinae: Pseudharpinia inexpectata, new species; Heterophoxus conlanae, new species, and H. ellisi, new species. Biogeographically, the subfamilies Parharpiniinae and Pontharpiniinae, dominant along temperate-tropical Indo-Pacific and antipodean shores, appear to be relict along northeastern Pacific shores. The Brolginae, common in protected coastal shallows of the northern and southern hemispheres, the\n     Phoxocephalinae, world-wide mainly in deeper shelf waters, and the\n     Harpiniinae, dominant on finer sediments and in deeper waters of the northern\n     hemisphere, are well represented in the present study region. Within the\n     present study region, the total number of species of these five subfamilies\n     combined is slightly less than that of the single regional subfamily\n     Metharpiniinae (Jarrett and Bousfield, 1994). The present species were also\n     taken less abundantly at stations with sandy sedimentary bottoms. Such bias\n     may reflect their overall preference for finer, softer sediments, at greater\n     depths, habitats that were not extensively sampled in present surveys. Only a\n     few species of these subfamilies, notably within the primitive sand-burrowing\n     Pontharpiniinae, occur commonly intertidally.",

            "description": "In August 1991, satellite-linked platform transmitter terminals\n                        (PTTs) were attached to four spotted seals (Phoca largha)\n                        captured near a coastal haul out at Utukok Pass in the\n                        northeastern Chukchi Sea. The locations and diving behavior of\n                        the seals were monitored for periods of 64-259 days. Usable\n                        position information was obtained for about 50% of the days that\n                        the PTTs were operational. During August-October, seals made\n                        long feeding trips southwestward into the southern Chukchi Sea\n                        and returned to haul outs at Kasegaluk Lagoon. Durations of\n                        at-sea periods ranged from 8 to 902 hours, and the four seals on\n                        average spent 7% of their time hauled out. Three seals with still\n                        functional PTTs began their southward migration in October; two\n                        of them used haul outs in the Kotzebue Sound region and the\n                        northern Seward Peninsula. Seals migrated southward through\n                        Bering Strait in November and were near St. Lawrence Island in\n                        mid-December. The two seals whose PTTs worked into\n                        March-April spent the late winter and early spring in the sea ice\n                        south and southeast of St. Matthew Island. Haul outs on ice were\n                        infrequent, with seals hauled out only 6% of the time, on average.\n                        The number of dives to greater than 10 m depth averaged 160 and\n                        284 per day for two of the seals. All dives were to depths less\n                        than 100 m, and most lasted for less than 10 minutes.\n\n                        This study demonstrated the utility of satellite-linked telemetry for\n                        studying the biology of spotted seals. Modifications to PTT\n                        programming should allow future efforts to gather more detailed\n                        information on movements and diving behavior.",

Suspensions with a mean particle size of 8.5 \u00b5m attenuate 660-nm light 15 times more efficiently than suspensions of similar particles with a mean diameter of 48 \u00b5m. Theoretical calculations of attenuation, based on scattering by spherical particles with the measured size distributions, underestimate observed attenuation by factors of 2-4, apparently because the nonspherical shape and roughness typical of natural particles create an effective optical diameter larger than that for a sphere of equal volume. These laboratory results agree with the\ntrend established from a survey of published field data showing that calibration slopes experience a steady increase from inshore\nhigh-energy waters, where large particles are common, to offshore low-energy waters, where large particles are rare.",

            "description": "The weekly mass flux at C and phytoplankton pigments at five depths in the main basin of Puget Sound, a deep (~200 m) fjordlike\nestuary, was sampled for a year with moored sequentially-sampling sediment traps. Flux measurements were compared with weekly\nsamples of suspended pigments in the euphotic zone and bi-monthly samples of total suspended matter and particulate C throughout the\nwater column at the mooring site. Seasonal changes in the total mass flux at all depths were small; instead, physical (river runoff, bottom resuspension) and biological (phytoplankton blooms) events caused occasional sharp increases on a weekly scale. The dry weight\nconcentration of pigments in the trap samples mirrored the concentration of pigments in the euphotic zone suspended matter, increasing from 0.01% in winter to a maximum of 0.65% in the late summer. Bloom-induced changes in the pigment concentration were observed almost simultaneously in the euphotic zone and in the traps to a depth of 160 m, indicating a rapid vertical transfer of surface-originating particles by organic aggregates. In contrast to the strong seasonal signal in the pigment concentration, C concentration varied by only a factor of three during the year. The seasonal trend of C/pigment ratios in the C flux arises from at least two sources: (1) a balance between terrestrial sources of C during the high-runoff winter season and in-situ primary production in spring and summer, and (2) cycling of C through the zooplankton population. Budget calculations suggest that the loss of primary-produced C and pigment from the euphotic zone by settling is ~5% regardless of season. On an annual basis, this C flux (16 g m-2) is sufficient to support previously measured values of benthic aerobic respiration at the mooring site. To account for other C sinks such as burial, predation and chemical oxidation, however, terrestrial C sources and alternate transport pathways, such as vertical advection and sediment movement down the steep basin walls, are\nnecessary.",

            "description": "Contemporary processes controlling the off-shelf transport of suspended particles in the vicinity of Quinault submarine canyon on the\nWashington continental shelf were identified using CTD/transmissometer surveys and a three-month deployment of current\nmeter/transmissometer/sequentially-sampling sediment trap arrays. Resuspension events on the shelf create a shelf-break-depth nepheloid\nlayer that transports sediment off the shelf. Fluctuations of the particle concentration in this layer were positively and significantly correlated\nwith the short-term (9.5 days) temporal variation of trap deposition rates in the canyon and on the adjacent open slope. Contributions to\nthe deposition rate from downslope transport along the canyon floor, from local resuspension of canyon sediments, and from particles in\nthe ambient bottom nepheloid layer were negligible. These observations indicate that deposition on the slope is controlled by fast-sinking\n(100-200 m day) amorphous aggregates that scavenge fine-grained particles from the shelf-break-depth nepheloid layer. Areal\nvariations in the deposition rate result from interaction between the regional flow pattern and the canyon geometry. Rates were high ( 60 g\nm day) in the canyon upper head because it indents the shelf and thus underlies the shelf-break-depth nepheloid layer created by\nacross-isobath advective transport of resuspended mid-shelf silty sediments. Rates were low (3-6 g m day) elsewhere in the canyon\nand on the open slope because the transport is much less rapid and direct, occurring primarily by horizontal diffusion rather than\nacross-isobath advection of particles, and because the availability of erodable fine-grained particles is reduced in the relatively coarser\nouter-shelf sediments. Trap deposition rate, extrapolated to an annual rate based on a historical seasonal pattern of shelf storms, was\nconsistent with published radiometric bottom sediment accumulation rates throughout the study area.",

At both vent fields, emissions from point and diffuse hydrothermal sources coalesced into a single 200-m-thick plume elongated in the direction of current flow and with characteristic temperature anomalies of 0.02-0.05\u00b0C and light-attenuation anomalies of 0.01-0.08 m (10-80 \u00b5g/l above background). Temperature anomalies in the core of each plume were uniform as far downcurrent as the plumes were mapped (10-15 km). Downcurrent light-attenuation trends were non-uniform and differed between plumes, apparently because different vent fluid chemistries at each field cause significant differences in the settling characteristics of the hydrothermal precipitates. Vent fluids from the SSS are metal-dominated and mostly precipitate very fine-grained hydrous Fe-oxides that remain suspended in the plume. Vent fluids from the ES are sulfur-dominated and precipitate a high proportion of coarser-grained Fe-sulfides that rapidly settle from the plume. The integrated flux of each vent field was estimated from measurements of the advective transport of each plume. Heat flux was 1700 \uffb1 1100 MW from the ES and 580 \uffb1 351 MW from the SSS. Particle flux varied from 546 \uffb1 312 g/s to 204 \uffb1 116 g/s at the ES depending on distance from the vent field, and was 92 \uffb1 48 g/s from the SSS.",

            "description": "The first water-column survey of the axial valley of the Gorda Ridge, a slow- to medium-rate spreading center within 300 km of the coast\nof Oregon and California, found strong evidence for ongoing hydrothermal venting. At the northern end of the ridge, anomalously high concentrations of helium-3, dissolved manganese, particulate iron, and methane confirmed the hydrothermal origin of above-bottom\nplumes identifiable as maxima in light-attenuation profiles. The presence of excess radon-222 and the highly soluble hydrothermal\nprecipitate anhydrite in the plumes require a local vent source; the precipitation of anhydrite requires fluid temperatures of at least 130\u00b0C.\nIndications of hydrothermal activity elsewhere in the axial valley were inconclusive.",
