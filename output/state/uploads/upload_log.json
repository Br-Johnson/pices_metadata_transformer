Instrumentation recorded surface and geostrophic winds, ocean current velocity at 2 and 30 meter depths, and camp (floe) position.  Data available are daily average values for each parameter at each camp, as well as ice velocity and smoothed position data.  Surface pressure and geostrophic wind data at 6-hourly intervals are also available.",

      "description": "We will conduct a pilot study on the use of airborne lidar (LIght Detecting And Ranging) and 3-chip digital video to assess epipelagic biological features such as forage fish\nschools, zooplankton, large individual fish (e.g., salmon), marine mammals and seabirds. The results of this study are designed to supplement new and ongoing research in the Bering Sea and North Pacific, addressing several of the NPMR issues including monitoring, forage fish and apex community ecology, and effects of climate change on the biology of the systems. This study falls in the categories of remote sensing and field studies.\n\nA lidar produces short pulses of laser light which pass through the water's  surface and reflect off biological features in the water column, and processes the returning signal. When mounted along with a video camera in a down-looking configuration from the\nbelly of an aircraft, we can use the combined data to produce a three dimensional array of the biological features. When conducted over ground survey transects that include\noceanography, net catches, acoustics, and bird and mammal counts, the processed lidar and video images can be properly interpreted and related to ocean conditions. We propose to overfly ground survey transects, collect continuous spatial data within each\ntransect, and replicate the surveys both during the day and at night. We plan to conduct these surveys synoptic with ongoing ground survey programs (including Inner Fronts, US GLOBEC and/or Ocean Carrying Capacity).\n\nThis technique could overcome many of the shortcomings of traditionally applied technology. \nThose include: \n1) the lack of spatial resolution, \n2) difficulty in performing synoptic data collection, \n3) a mismatch in comparing temporal and spatial scale (due to the speed of vessels versus the time frame of biological activity bursts or diurnal patterns), and \n4) high cost (ground surveys can be reduced). In California, lidar surveys have been\nevaluated for assessments of pelagic sardines and anchovy as a way to reduce the shipboard time involved due to the low relative cost of remote sensing at high speeds.\n\nIn order to fully evaluate this  technique in Alaskan waters, we intend to conduct surveys in two separate oceanographic regions, namely the Bering Sea and northern regions of the Pacific Ocean adjacent to the Alaskan coast. \n\nThis project also includes;\n\nBrenda Norcross \nUniversity of Alaska Fairbanks \n\nJames Churnside \nEnvironmental Technology Laboratory, NOAA\nAn NPMR project",

      "description": "To date, most lower trophic level research on the eastern Bering Sea shelf has concentrated on the role of the spring diatom bloom as the main annual production event. Over the Middle Shelf Domain, primary and secondary productions occur\nthroughout the summer supported by regenerated nutrients. During this period, standing stock of chlorophyll is relatively low (0.5 - 2 \u00b5g/l). Periodic outbreaks of diatoms can occur in response to erosion of the pycnocline and injection of nitrate and silicate\ninto the surface waters. Between these outbreaks, nano- and microzooplankton (<200 \u00b5m) are hypothesized to dominate nutrient cycling. During these periods microzooplankton may also provide the intermediary link between small flagellated primary producers and food for juvenile fishes. Recent recurring \"blooms\"\nof the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi require us to achieve a better understanding of summertime nutrient recycling and trophic transfer so that we can predict the effect, if any, E. huxleyi will have on higher trophic levels. We plan to dissect the summer pelagic food web and nutrient cycle of the Middle Shelf Domain to determine the relative\ncontribution of microzooplankton to these processes. Specifically we will investigate nutrient cycling and trophic transfer during two distinct phytoplankton communities: small flagellates (coccolithophores or other species) and diatoms. Juvenile Pollock, a nodal species in the Bering Sea ecosystem, forage on particle-grazing mesozooplankton and variations in summer food supply may affect their ability to accumulate energy stores for the harsh Subarctic winters.\n\nThis project also includes;\n\nEvelyn Lessard \nUniversity of Washington \n\nJeffrey Napp \nAlaska Fisheries Science Center, NOAA \n7600 Sand Point Way NE\nSeattle, WA  98115\njeff.napp@noaa.gov\nAn NPMR project",

      "description": "Sustainable fisheries require 1) viable stock populations with appropriate harvest limits and 2) appropriate habitat for the fisheries to survive, forage, seek refuge, grow and reproduce.  Unlike some deep-water rocky habitats, those formed from deep-water stands of coral may be vulnerable to fishing disturbance and therefore affect on the fishery may be confounded by simultaneous loss of habitat during fishing effort.  Thus, the rate at which habitat can be restored is a critical aspect of fishery management.  The purpose of this study was to characterize growth rates for a habitat-forming deep-sea coral.  Two nearly complete colonies of red tree coral (Primnoa resedaeformis) collected from off southeast Alaska were used for an analysis of age and growth characteristics.  CAT scans revealed that colonies consisted of multiple settlement events, where older basal structures provide for settlement of new colonies.  The decay of exogenous 210Pb over the length of the colony was used to validate age estimates from growth zone counts.  Age estimates were over 100 yr for sections near the heavily calcified base.  Based on validated growth zone counts, growth of red tree coral ranged from 1.60 to 2.32 cm per year in height and was approximately 0.36 mm per year in diameter.  These growth rates suggest that the fishery habitat created by red tree coral is extremely vulnerable to bottom fishing activities and may take over 100 years to recover.  \n\n [ Co-PIs: Gregor M.

      "description": "Our objective is to put in place a monitoring program for the eastern North Pacific and southern Bering Sea region. Large scale changes in Pacific salmon populations in all regions of North America have been related to climate change in this century. The likely initial cause is changes in the structure of the ocean and atmosphere. These changes are known to affect the abundance, productivity, and community structure of continental shelf and open ocean plankton communities. Changes in plankton abundance have been related to the changes in salmon abundance, and reduced ocean productivity is probably the causal link leading to poor ocean survival for salmon. Climate changes experienced in recent years are consistent with expectations from models for early stages of global warming. In all regions of the West Coast of North America there have been extremely sudden changes in the productivity of salmon populations. These changes have not been expected from the standard fisheries management theories, nor could they be forecast from available data. However, the changes have had devastating economic impacts on coastal communities from Oregon to (most recently) Alaska. The pattern of failure in year-class strength of Bristol Bay sockeye salmon and other stocks and species demonstrates that the cause of the sudden downturn has in large part a marine origin. However, salmon spend part of their life history in both coastal and oceanic marine environments, and are therefore subject to environmental changes occurring in both regions. \n\nWe seek to put in place a monitoring framework using the Hardy Continuous  Plankton Recorder (CPR). This is an established technology widely used in the North Atlantic. The changes that the Atlantic CPR program have documented in the 1990s are now being linked to the decline in Atlantic salmon populations, that are also experiencing substantially increased ocean mortality.\n\nOur project involves sampling of the plankton in multiple regions of the offshore and coastal regions of the eastern North Pacific and southern Bering Sea. The monitoring lines will (a) sample the plankton along the coastal migration routes of the juvenile salmon in four locations, (b) quantify the distribution and abundance of shelf plankton populations in the Atlantic (Steele 1998; the relationship of shelf to offshore populations is unclear in the Pacific because of a lack of data), and (c) permit cross-comparisons with almost all existing eastern Pacific ocean surveys (CalCOFI in California; Line P in Canada; and GAK-1 near Seward, Alaska).\n\nThis project also includes; Dr. Sonia Batten, Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science, 1 Walker Terrace, The Hoe, Plymouth, United Kingdom PL1 3BN,\n44 1752 221-112\nsoba@wpo.nerc.ac.uk\nAn NPMR project",

      "description": "This project involves employing a new stable nitrogen isotope labeling technique for measuring denitrification rates in surface sediments of the Bering Continental Shelf using an existing shipboard core incubation system. Two existing ship time commitments in the summer of 1999 will be used to undertake the field research with follow-up laboratory analyses in 1999-2000. Based upon recent work, we expect that sediment-based processes can directly decrease concentrations of nitrate in overlying waters on large, shallow shelves. For example, in a paper recently published in the Journal of Geophysical Research (Vol. 104: 7827-7836, April 15, 1999), we provide evidence that 5 to 20% of nitrate currently brought onto the northern Bering Shelf may be lost through denitrification before export off the shelf in the Chukchi Sea. This sediment-based process therefore can have a significant impact on overall ecosystem fertility, and directly impact the biomass of higher trophic levels sequestered within commercially important fisheries and marine mammal populations utilized for subsistence.  The development of spatially extensive estimates of denitrification rates on the Bering continental shelf will improve our understanding of overall carbon and nitrogen cycling in the productive water, and therefore contribute to the North Pacific Marine Research program's goals of developing predictive capabilities for ecological response to expected global change.

      "description": "Daily fields obtained from a 17-yr atmospheric GCM simulation are used to\n     study the surface sensible and latent heat flux variability and its relationship to the\n     sea level pressure (SLP) field. The fluxes are analyzed over the North Pacific and\n     Atlantic Oceans during winter. The leading mode of interannual SLP variability\n     consists of a single center associated with the Aleutian low in the Pacific, and a\n     dipole pattern associated with the Icelandic low and Azores high in the Atlantic.\n     The surface flux anomalies are organized by the low-level atmospheric circulation\n     associated with these modes in agreement with previous observational studies.\n\n       The surface flux variability on all of the timescales examined, including\n     intraseasonal, interannual, 3\uff9610 day, and 10\uff9630 day, is maximized along the\n     north and west edges of both oceans and between Japan and the date line at\n        35\u00b0N in the Pacific. The intraseasonal variability is approximately 3\uff965 times\n     larger than the interannual variability, with more than half of the total surface flux\n     variability occurring on timescales of less than 1 month. Surface flux variability in\n     the 3\uff9610-day band is clearly associated with midlatitude synoptic storms.\n     Composites indicate upward (downward) flux anomalies that exceed |30 W\n     m2| occur to the west (east) of storms, which move eastward across the oceans\n     at 10\u00b0\uff9615\u00b0 per day. The SLP and surface flux anomalies are also strong and\n     coherent in the 10\uff9630-day band but are located farther north, are broader in\n     scale, and propagate 3\uff964 times more slowly eastward than the synoptic\n     disturbances.\n\n       The sensible and latent heat flux are proportional to the wind speed multiplied\n     by the air\uff96sea temperature and humidity difference, respectively. The anomalous\n     wind speed has the greatest influence on surface flux anomalies in the subtropics\n     and western Pacific, while the air temperature and moisture anomalies have the\n     greatest impact in the northeast Pacific and north of 40\u00b0N in the Atlantic. The\n     covariance between the wind speed and the air temperature or humidity\n     anomalies, while generally small, is non-negligible on synoptic timescales.",

It focuses on the basin, since a thorough review of the shelves has recently been completed (Schumacher and Stabeno 1998).  Further, since this volume contains an extensive review of the water property characteristics (Luchin et al., chapter 3, this volume), the primary goal is to review and update circulation over the basin.  We begin with the known and estimated transports through each of the passes of the Aleutian Islands, followed by a discussion of the surface and deep currents of the Bering Sea basin and the flow on the Bering Sea shelves.",
