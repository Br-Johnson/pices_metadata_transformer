New observations are entered serially as they arrive, into the next available record on the file. The file is long enough for approximately 40 days worth of data. No sorting or other operations are done before writing to the file.\n\n  The first 2 records of the file are reserved for a directory.

            "description": "This file provides storage for a global 2.5 degree resolution accumulation of SST information leading to a monthly determination of mean SST and standard deviation within each grid box. Boxes are bordered by meridians and parallels which are multiples of 2.5 degrees in latitude and longitude, so that 4 boxes may be combined to produce boxes centered on intersections of meridians and parallels which are multiples of 5 degrees in latitude and longitude.\n\nThree quantities are stored for each grid box and are operated twice weekly with newly arrived observations. These are 1) the number of observations occurring in the box, 2) the sum of the measured temperatures, and 3) the sum of these temperatures. From these, a mean temperature and standard deviation are derived for each box at the end of each month.\n\n  There are 144 X 72 = 10,368 boxes covering the globe. Each requires 3 words--N, T, T2-- or 12 bytes of storage. Seven latitudinal rows of 144 boxes will fit on one track so that 10 2/7 tracks are required each month. Four months' data will\nbe maintained on disk so that a quarterly report can be comprised from the file directly. The fourth month makes provision for lags in processing. One directory record will be needed, and 42 tracks are required in all.\n\n  The Office of Satellite Data Processing and Distribution (OSDPC) keeps this data for a month, then sends it to the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) for archiving.

            "description": "This data set is a year-long file of monthly mean satellite-derived temperatures produced via manipulation of the data stored in NSS.PSATAV.SST.MOMEAN. For each month of the year, and for each point of its geographical grid, it contains 1) the month's mean temperature; 2) the standard deviation of a single measure; and 3) the number of observations\nentering into the mean. Each of these quantities is stored as a 2-byte integer.\n\n  The geographical grid establishes a global field of boxes at 2.5 degree resolution. Boxes are bordered by meridians and parallels which are multiples of 2.5 degrees latitude/longitude, so that 4 boxes may be combined to produce boxes centered on intersections of meridians and parallels which are multiples of 5 degrees in latitude/longitude.\n\n  New data is added to the file monthly via processing of the accumulated observations stored in SS.PSATAV.SST.MOMEAN. Twelve months' data will be maintained on disk so that a single yearly archive tape can be copied from it for future use in deriving a multi-year satellite based climatology. Seventy-two tracks are therefore required for the data set which will contain 12 X 72 = 864 logical records.\n\n  The Office of Satellite Data Processing and Distribution (OSDPC) keeps this data for a month, then sends it to the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) for archiving.  For current data, contact John Sapper at OSDPC,  telephone 301-457-0914 ext.148, e-mail: john.sapper@noaa.gov.  For archived data contact Thomas Ross at NCDC, telephone 828-271-4499, e-mail: tom.ross@noaa.gov.",

            "description": "This file is a geographically organized data base of satellite SST observation matched with coincident buoy, wx ship, and perhaps XBT data and the SST field data which have been quality controlled. The file generally contains all previous matched observations within the last 30 days. The file contains 5 X 5 degree latitude/longitude blocks which in turn are\nsubdivided into 1 degree blocks.\n\nThe coincident buoy, wx ship and/or XBT data will occupy the first 32 bytes, followed by the field data in the next 32 bytes and the satellite observation which can be of variable size, in which the first 19 halfwords are of fixed format (i.e. contain the core information) and the remainder will have up to a maximum size of 120 bytes. Within the observation no odd full word may be negative except the first full word which must be negative. The access routine COAR2 should be used to reference data in this data set.\n\nThe file has overflow records and as such expands and decreases as data are available. The file holds 1 month worth of data. The physical records are one track (13024 bytes) long as are the logical records. The first record is a directory, containing the block directory. Each succeeding record contains a subdirectory followed by the observations.\n\n  The Office of Satellite Data Processing and Distribution (OSDPC) keeps this data for a month, then sends it to the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) for archiving.

            "description": "This file is a reservoir for AVHRR and HIRS/2 target data collocated with SST observation and buoy observation data. The target and SST observation data for selected geographic locations are written from a temporary file by an operational copy program once a day. The temporary file is created by the SST reduction program (MUT) on an orbit by orbit basis. Once a day, coincident buoy data is added to the appropriate target records in the Target Matchup Data Base (TMDB) by a merge program. A tape archive of the data base is made periodically by copying the disk to tape.\n\nThe file is a circular file of logical records, each 3150 bytes long, arranged in physical records of 3150 bytes. The first record is a header record containing a data record pointer and the starting and ending times of each directory record. The next 28 records are reserved as directory records. Directory records contain such information as the data record numbers, latitude and longitude, and times for groups of 150 data records. Each succeeding 3150 byte logical record is a data record which is the length of one colocated AVHRR and HIRS/2 target data matched with coincident buoy data and satellite SST observations. Note, the header and data records for the TARGET MATCHUP INITIAL STORAGE FILE (TMISF) have the same length and format as that of the TMDB. The file is large enough to hold 4200 observations.\n\nObservations are added to the file by checking the header to determine the next available record number. When the file becomes full, it is recycled beginning with the first data record (record #30) for observation storage. The appropriate directory record is then updated.\n\n\n  The Office of Satellite Data Processing and Distribution (OSDPC) keeps this data for a month, then sends it to the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) for archiving.

It is produced on the 3rd of each month, archiving data for the previous month. The Target Matchup Data Base contains raw data targets (i.e. AVHRR and HIRS/2 raw data, calibration coefficients, and earth location information) as well as any retrieved SST's for selected geographic positions. If a target position coincides with a fixed buoy location, that buoy SST is appended to the target (targets and buoys are matched within 24 hours). The SST Matchup Data Base is a geographically organized file of satellite SST and buoy SST matchups where the buoy and satellite match within 100 km and 48 hours.\n\nThe tape is a 9-track, 1600 bpi, unlabeled, odd-parity, binary tape produced on an IBM 360/195 computer. The tape has three physical files, each ending with a physical end-of-file mark. The first file has only one record (physical) which contains information about the data on the tape and serves as a header file. The second file has 4232 physical records of 3150 bytes each which contains the Target Matchup Data Base records. The third file has 900 physical records of 13024 bytes each which contain the SST Matchup Data Base records.

            "description": "This project will expand the scope of the Alaska Native Harbor Seal Commission's (ANHSC) present biological sampling efforts to include subsistence hunters in communities west of Prince William Sound. The Commission is a tribal consortium\nconcerned with self-management of the harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) as a subsistence resource. The ANHSC already conducts a biological sampling program in nine communities and participates in the harvest data assessment program with the\nAlaska Department of Fish and Game Subsistence Division. We plan to expand this effort to nine more communities in western Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. Local technicians are selected and trained by the Commission's staff to perform basic necropsies on seals taken by subsistence hunters. Samples from these seals are sent to the University of Alaska Museum (UAM) for distribution to ongoing investigations and for archiving in the permanent collections.  Tissue samples will be archived in the Alaska Frozen Tissue Collection (AFTC) which has become the primary regional archive for frozen zoological samples and a major contributor to environmental studies of the North Pacific and Arctic oceans. It is now the world's third largest frozen tissue collection for wild mammals (Hafner et al. 1997). The increasingly powerful tools of molecular biology and biochemistry and the need to monitor perturbation of the environment are accelerating both collection growth and usage. In addition to supporting expanded\nmonitoring and sampling by the ANHSC, this project supports additional student help at UAM to process the increased number of samples. This project will increase the scope of sampling from a protected and potentially threatened high-trophic-level subsistence resource, and increase the scope of Native involvement in the study and management of marine resources.

Records 4-19 contain the best threshold values of the reflectance for the two instruments for up to 8 satellites. The AVHRR thresholds are in the first record of each pair, the HIRS/2 in the second.

The primary objective of the AVHRR instrument is to provide cloud top and sea surface temperatures through passively measured visible, near infrared and thermal infrared spectral radiation bands.\n\n  NOAA Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites obtain global imagery daily which are transmitted to the Command and Data Acquisition (CDA) stations at Wallops Island, Virginia, and Fairbanks, Alaska. The CDA stations relay the data to the National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service (NESDIS), located in Suitland, Maryland, for processing and distribution to forecasting centers of the U.S. and other nations.\n\n  GAC (Global Area Coverage) data is produced from AVHRR data aboard NOAA operational polar orbiting satellites. The GAC data are produced on-board the satellite by sampling the AVHRR 1 km data to 4 km resolution by averaging\nalong-scan groups of four samples out of five and skipping every third scan.  The data includes all 5 channels at 10 bit precision, with time tags, Earth location, and calibration information.\n\n  The LAC Level 1B data are 1 km resolution data that are recorded on-board the satellite and dumped at the CDA stations, at some later time.\n\n  The HRPT Level 1B data are 1 km direct readout data obtained as the satellite passes over CDA Stations. Hardcopy imagery from HRPT data are also available. Each dataset is generally 10-12 minutes in duration, which requires 3 frames\nper channel.",

The data is also stored for transmission to the Navy's Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center (FNMOC) and to the Air Force\nGlobal Weather Central (AFGWC).\n  \n  Each of the DMSP satellites flies in a sun-synchronous, near-polar orbit. For a satellite in sun synchronous orbit, the ascending equatorial crossing time remains relatively constant with respect to the local time throughout the lifetime of the satellite.\n  \n  The SSM/I is a seven channel, four frequency, linearly-polarized passive microwave radiometric system which measures atmospheric, ocean and terrain microwave brightness temperatures at 19.35, 22.235, 37.0 and 85.5 GHz. SSM/I's\noutput voltages are transmitted to the FNMOC in Monterey, California, where they are converted to sensor counts. FNMOC then converts the sensor counts into antenna temperatures (Temperature Data Records - TDR), brightness temperatures (Sensor Data Records - SDR) and derived geophysical parameters (Environmental Data Records -EDR). SSM/I TDRs are sent to NOAA-SAA for their on-line database. The SSM/I rotates continuously about an axis parallel to the local spacecraft vertical at 31.6 rpm and measures the upwelling scene brightness temperatures over an angular sector of 102.4 degrees about the subsatellite track. This results in a swath width of approximately 1400 km.\n\n  The EDR data are derived from TDRs and SDRs, and measure various parameters over the ocean, ice and land surfaces. There are five oceanic parameters: surface wind speed, cloud water content, water vapor content, rainfall intensity and liquid water content. There are four ice parameters: ice concentration, ice age, ice edge and cloud water content over ice. There are eight land parameters: rain intensity, liquid water content, surface moisture, cloud water content, snow water content, surface character, surface temperature and cloud amount. Not all parameters are simultaneously possible.",

            "description": "The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) is a Department of Defense program which is responsible for designing, building, launching and operating polar orbiting meteorological satellites. The satellites can broadcast visual,\ninfrared and microwave imagery directly to transportable tactical sites around the world. The data is also stored for transmission to the Navy's Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center (FNMOC) and to the Air Force\nGlobal Weather Central (AFGWC).\n \n  Each of the DMSP satellites flies in a sun-synchronous, near-polar orbit. For a satellite in sun synchronous orbit, the ascending equatorial crossing time remains relatively constant with respect to the local time throughout the lifetime of the satellite.\n \n  The SSM/I is a seven-channel, four-frequency, linearly-polarized, passive microwave radiometric system.  The SSM/I receives both horizontally and vertically linearly polarized radiation at 19.3, 37.0 and 85.5 GHz and vertical only at 22.2 GHz.  SSM/I's output voltages are transmitted to the Navy's Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center (FNMOC) in Monterey, CA, where they are converted to sensor counts.  FNMOC then converts the sensor counts into antenna temperatures (TDR), brightness temperatures (SDR) and derived geophysical parameters (EDR).  SSM/I TDR data are sent to NOAA-SAA for their on-line database.  \n\n  The SSM/I rotates continuously about an axis parallel to the local spacecraft vertical at 31.6 rpm and measures the upwelling scene brightness temperatures over an angular sector of 102.4 degrees about the subsatellite track.  The results in a swath width of approximately 1400 km.\n\n  The SSM/I TDR data set is produced by the NOAA/National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service (NESDIS).  NESDIS' Satellite Active Archive (SAA) ingests the data from NESDIS (as of 4/1/97) on an orbit-by-orbit basis and assembles the data into an approximate one day file set.  The data is stored as SSM/I antenna temperatures for each of seven instrument channels.  The earth location (latitude and longitude) values are assigned for every data point. \nHot and cold calibration values are also stored within the file.\n\n  The data files can be converted to brightness temperatures by applying a conversion utility.  Each file set is approximately 80 Mbytes (uncompressed).  This data set is archived on-line and is available for distribution on a variety of magnetic media:  9 track 6250 bpi round tapes, 3480 cartridges, 4mm and 8mm tapes.  Similar data sets are available for the SSM/I\ninstrument aboard the F11 and F12 DMSP satellites.",

            "description": "The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) is a Department of Defense program which is responsible for designing, building, launching and operating polar orbiting meteorological satellites. The satellites can broadcast visual, infrared and microwave imagery directly to transportable tactical sites around the world. The data is also stored for transmission to the Navy's Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center (FNMOC) and to the Air Force Global Weather Central (AFGWC).\n\n  Each of the DMSP satellites flies in a sun-synchronous, near-polar orbit. For a satellite in sun synchronous orbit, the ascending equatorial crossing time remains relatively constant with respect to the local time throughout the lifetime of the satellite.\n \n  The SSM/T2 is the first operational microwave water vapor sounder to be placed in orbit. It is a scanning, five channel, passive and total power microwave radiometer system. The SSM/T2 consists of five channels: three water vapor channels centered around the 183.31 GHz water vapor line, a 91 GHz channel, and a 150 GHz channel. The SSM/T2 observation rate is 7.5 scans per minute. There are 28 observations (beam positions) per scan for each of the five channels, with each observation having a spatial resolution of approximately 48 km. All five channels have coincident centers. The total swath width for the SSM/T2 is approximately 1400 km.",

Each instrument has different characteristics, resolutions, scan properties, etc. which are described below. This system is onboard the NOAA 6 through NOAA 14 and TIROS-N satellites. \n\n  The HIRS/2 instrument is a step-scanned multi-channel spectrometer with 20 channels primarily in the infrared region of the spectrum including both longwave (15 micron) and shortwave (4.3 micron), plus one channel in the visible (.69 micron) region. Resolution of 17 km at nadir, but at the end of a scan, resolution is 58 km cross-track by 30 km along-track with variable underlap between steps and scans. The data include all 20 channels at 13 bit precision with time tags, Earth location and calibration information. \n\n  The SSU is a step-scanned infrared spectrometer with 3 channels in the 15 micron C02 band. The 3 SSU channels have the same frequency but different cell pressures. Resolution of 147 km at subpoint with an underlap between adjacent scan lines of approximately 62 km at nadir. The data include all 3 channels at 12 bit precision, with time tags, Earth location and calibration information. \n\n  The MSU instrument is a passive scanning microwave spectrometer with four channels in the 5.5 micron oxygen region. The 124 km resolution at the subpoint creates an underlap of 115 km between adjacent scan lines. Data include all 4 channels at 12 bit precision with time tags, Earth location and calibration information.",

            "description": "The SALMON Project is currently utilizing the Arctic Region Supercomputing Center (ARSC) to run numerical simulations of the circulation of the coastal Gulf of Alaska. The model in use is called the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS), developed jointly by researchers at the University of California at Los Angeles and Rutgers University. It is run at a resolution of three kilometers and aligned in a nested grid configuration with Al Hermann's North East Pacific (NEP) domain. Open boundary conditions are provided by the NEP model and COADS monthly mean wind fields are used for the surface forcing. Tidal forcings are computed from Mike Foreman's northeast Pacific Ocean high-resolution assimilating tide model and are applied along the open boundaries of the model domain. Fresh water inputs consist of a continuous line source of monthly mean values computed by Tom Royer's hydrologic model. The latest ROMS model run simulated three idealized years of circulation in the northern Gulf of Alaska. \n\n  There are thirty vertical levels using a nonlinear stretching to improve the surface resolution in deep water. The vertical mixing scheme is KPP with both surface and bottom boundary layers. The open boundary conditions are Flather/Chapman for the barotropic fields; these provide the tidal elevation and currents added to the barotropic fields from the NEP model. The baroclinic fields have a modified radiation condition where the direction of the phase velocity determines the strength of the nudging to the NEP fields. There is also a ten-point wide nudging band on temperature and salinity along the open boundaries, again using the NEP fields.\n\n  Our future plans include coupled ecosystem models and the use of NCEP daily winds, making sure that all the nested models use common forcing fields. We will be running for specific years, such as 2000 and 2001.\n\n\n  A Sea-Air-Land Modeling and Observing Network (SALMON) Project.",

This bathymetric data set consists of NODC soundings point data which has been translated to NAD83 where necessary. The data is of very high resolution near some coastal areas and very coarse in others, in the deeper parts of the continental shelf and open ocean, there is hardly any coverage at all. A map individual data points in this data set is shown below. For more information on this data set see the SciFish website http://www.scifish.com/newWeb/productIndiv.py?2.\n\n  In order to get a high resolution bathymetric data set which was capable of supplying a numerical model with adequate coverage on a 3 km grid the SALMON Project group at UAF decided to combine a number of data sets. For the deep ocean, we decided to use ETOPO5 a global data set of land and sea elevations on a 5 minute latitude/longitude grid. For the coastal areas the SciFish data set was used and for the land the Smith and Sandwell 30 second gridded data was used. Routines written in the feely available software package called the Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) were used to combine these three data sets, grid them all onto a 30 second latitude/longitude grid and produce maps.\n\n  A Sea-Air-Land Modeling and Observing Network (SALMON) Project.",

The organization officially expanded to The Alaska Sea Otter& Steller Sea Lion Commission (TASSC). In 1992, the Commission developed regional management plans for each of its six regions. Recognized within these plans is a need for local participation in research and management. Research includes building regional capacity by training local residents on the methods of biological sampling of the northern sea otter. In 1995, the Commission received funding to implement a biological training program. Over 55 local people from within the six coastal regions received training. To date, 185 biological samples from subsistence harvested sea otters were collected for research. This project expands the biological sampling program to train local people on marine mammal and bird stranding protocols.\n\nThis project also includes;\n\nKimberly Williams \nAlaska Sea Otter & Steller Sea Lion Commission\n505 West Northern Lights Blvd.  Suite 217\nAnchorage, Alaska  99503-6199\n(907) 274-9799\nasoc@alaska.net\n\nAn NPMR project",

            "description": "Indigenous peoples, including the Aleut, Inupiat, Ittelman, Koryak, Siberian Yupik, and Alaska Yupik, have coexisted with the Bering Sea for over eight thousand years, living successfully by their understanding of the winds, tides, currents, climate, and sea ice to harvest fish and wildlife. Such traditional knowledge and wisdom long ago taught Alaska Natives that in order to thrive they must assume an active stewardship role with the land, the sea, and all its creatures. Through time, the Bering Sea has come to mean everything to coastal peoples: it is the spiritual, cultural, physical, and economic centerpoint of their lives. In the most profound sense, this sea and the people who live along its coast have become one.  As outside organizations identify research priorities and management decisions are being made, it is critical that Bering Sea coastal people, whose lives remain wholly dependent on an abundant and diverse marine ecosystem, have an active role in understanding the problems and policies affecting them, and to\ndecided what steps they need to take. However, because the coastal residents are organized into community, sub-regional, and regional groups, there is no forum for collective decisions on an ecosystem-wide basis. The Council of Elders' leadership is\nnecessary to unify and prioritize the research goals of the region's Native peoples.\n\nAn NPMR project",

They were largely collected in the Bering and Chukchi Seas, with some coverage for the Beaufort and East Siberian Seas, and with limited coverage for other portions of the Arctic Ocean. Data include that collected on Alpha Helix cruises 139, 165, 166, 174, 189, 190, 214, and 224 between 1990 and 1999. Other data were obtained from cruises of the RV OKEAN (1993), USCGC Polar Star (1993), Mendeleev (1993), USCGC Polar Sea (2000), U.S. Canada Arctic Ocean Section (1994), and Polarstern (1993).\n\n  Water column data include coverage from some to most stations on these cruises, and include bottle salinity, temperature, sigma-t, oxygen-18/16 ratios, phosphate, ammonia, silicate, nitrate, dissolved oxygen, iodine-129 concentrations, and chlorophyll a. Sediment data include plutonium and neptunium concentrations, including isotope data.\n\n  Biological data include radionuclide burdens in marine mammal tissues donated by subsistence hunters on the North Slope of Alaska and in the Resolute region of Canada.\n\n  The readme files include reference to published use of these data, as well as additional information on interpreting data columns and spreadsheet construction. Additional biological and chemical data are being prepared for distribution at this site, and will be available in the near future.\n\n\n  Data Citation: Cooper, L.W. 2001.

Chinook salmon have returned to Auke Creek since 1986 as a result of off-site releases of juveniles from other hatcheries. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), and its predecessor agency, the U.S. Bureau of Commercial Fisheries, began salmon research at Auke Creek in 1961. Several fish counting weirs were installed in Auke Creek to capture salmon adults during the early 1960s. In 1965, a permanent, low-height weir was constructed and was used until 1980, when a modern, two-way weir was built. Weir counts of sockeye salmon adults at Auke Creek began in 1963; other species were included after 1966. Sockeye smolts were counted in some years between 1963 and 1980, and other downstream migrants were counted after 1969.",

The returning LPW chinook salmon were composed of two stocks: Chickamin River stock and Unuk River stock.  Both of these stocks, originating from the Behm Canal area of southern Southeast Alaska have been cultured at LPW for seven generations.  Unuk River stock comprised 76.5% (1289 fish) of the returning fish, whereas Chickamin River stock comprised 23.5% (397 fish).  Of the total returning LPW chinook, 58.0% were males (978 fish), 40.6% were females (685 fish), and 1.4% were of undetermined sex (23 fish).  For both the Chickamin River stock and the Unuk River stock, 5 year old fish dominated the return.",

Three replicate samples of the upper water column are collected with a 20-m vertical tow using a 0.5 m diameter, 243 Fm mesh Norpac net.  Settled volumes are measured immediately in the laboratory, then samples are preserved for detailed microscopic analysis of species, stage and size composition and enumeration.

For smaller salmon averaging as little as 0.2 g, tags half this length can be used (lower picture).  Since 1968, 82 Federal, State, Indian, and private agencies in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, California, and British Columbia have released over 600 million salmon with CWTs. Currently, over 45 million young salmon are marked with CWTs and released to migrate into the Pacific Ocean every year.

            "description": "Observations of snowstorms were carried out around Ishikari Bay, Hokkaido,\n     Japan, from December 1991 to February 1992. On 15 January 1992, a\n     longitudinal-mode snowband was observed by a dual-Doppler radar system. The\n     snowband was composed of meso--scale (20 km) connective cloud\n     systems. The three-dimensional kinematic structures and organization processes\n     of the meso--scale systems were studied in detail.\n\n       Strong band-parallel winds appeared in the upper-north rear of the\n     meso--scale systems. Since their speed was faster than that of the cellular radar\n     echoes, the winds formed rear-to-front currents. Increasing in volume and speed,\n     the rear-to-front currents developed into meso- scale and penetrated toward\n     the lower front and lower south of the systems. Consequently, the rear-to-front\n     currents caused strong meso--scale convergence and the enhancement of\n     updrafts at their leading edges. The transport of the band-parallel momentum\n     greatly contributed to the successive development of new connective cells within\n     the systems and the organization of the meso--scale systems in the snowband.\n     Ice/snow particles were transported by the updrafts toward the rear and north of\n     the systems in the overlying stable layer. They then evaporated outside the clouds.\n     The downdraft caused by evaporative cooling played an important role in the\n     transport of band-parallel momentum from the upper to the lower levels and from\n     the outside to the inside of the snowband.",

The approach is a retrospective study of growth and survival of chum and pink salmon stocks from diverse locations including western Alaska. The operating hypothesis is that, because fluctuating ocean climate differs from\nwest to east in the historical record, salmon productivity (growth and survival) should also have varied concordantly, both in historical and spatial scales. Over thirty years of data suitable for testing this hypothesis and alternatives are available in archives of\nproduction statistics and scales. The method will entail retrospective time series analyses of salmon production and climate variation and will entail an analysis of spatial patterns of salmon production. Through this analysis we expect to identify factors affecting growth and survival of salmon from different parts of their range across the Subarctic Pacific.\n\nThis project also includes;\n\nWilliam Smoker \nUniversity of Alaska Fairbanks \n\nWilliam Heard \nAuke Bay Laboratory, Alaska Fisheries Science Center, NOAA \n\nPeter Hagen \nAlaska Department of Fish and Game \npeterh@adfg.state.ak.us\n\n\nCollaborators include Masahide Kaeriyama of Hokkaido Tokai\nUniversity, and Leonid Klyashtorin, VINRO, Russian Federation.\nAn NPMR project",

The question was large enough to demand the attention of oceanographic disciplines from both countries as well as from others.  After several conferences, it was decided to emphasize the \"Golden Triangle\" (the are encompassed southeastern Bering Sea shelf in an attempt to understand the bioproductivity of this region (Hood and Kelley 1974, Hood and Takenouti 1975).  In the beginning, it appeared most expedient, for logistic and funding reasons, to have each country pursue its part of the program independently.",

Reports in this series may achieve original observations (raw data) or contain preliminary or incomplete data.  These reports do not receive full editorial and peer review.  Reports may be highly individualized.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: Annually\n\nAccess constraints: Requests for one or two pages of data and/or short reports can usually be accommodated.\n\nUse constraints: Republications of materials in this report series may be authorized by the department\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system. NOAA makes no warranty, expressed or implied, nor does the fact of distribution constitute such a warranty.\n\nFGDC metadata date: 19980713\nFGDC metadata contact: Kimberly Bahl\nFGDC metadata standard: Content Standards for Digital Geospatial Metadata (version: FGDC-STD-001-1998)",

The existing weather buoys offer a geographically widespread network for observing the state of B.C.'s coastal ocean and any changes in marine ecosystems resulting from changing climate. The two departments are now working towards the concept of Marine Ecosystem ObServatories (MEOS) , adding new instruments to the buoys for measurements of ocean water properties and key biological fields.The first MEOS buoy has been placed in Saanich Inlet, near the Institute of Ocean Sciences, with easy access for testing and calibrating new sensors and methods. As resources become available, the instruments tested in Saanich Inlet may be added to other buoys in the existing AES/FOC network, or in other specialized locations such as Marine Protected Areas.",

BS FOCI was established to seek understanding of the factors that control abundance of fish populations, with a specific goal of reducing uncertainty in resource management decisions through ecological research on walleye Pollock and stock structure in the Bering Sea.  Using a competitive process, BS FOCI awarded research components to academic scientists from several universities and to scientists from NOAA's Alaska Fisheries Science Center and Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory.  BS FOCI developed collaborations with Russian, Korean and Japanese scientists.  The National research Council (1994) reviewed accomplishments and plans of  BS FOCI.",

The dataset has reformatted detailed data, any errors discovered corrected and extra information added to produce one complete dataset for the whole sampling period. This dataset contains total zooplankton wet weights/m3 for the whole period 1956 to 1980, as well as densities for five major taxa (copepods, chaetognaths, euphausiids, amphipods and Aglantha) from 1964 to 1967 and species identifications, counts and lengths for many samples collected between 1968 to 1980. Document comes with a diskette containing the corrected detailed zooplankton data, methods used to collect and process the data and other pertinent information about the data.",

The U.S. Department of the Interior's Minerals Management Service (MMS) has held four OCS lease sales in the Bering Sea.  More than $100 million has been spent on environmental studies to support OCS lease-sale proposals in the Bering Sea region.  Major issues and concerns associated with OCS exploration activities have been identified and migrated.  Twenty-four exploratory wells have been drilled without finding commercial quantities of oil or gas.  Except for the North Aleutian basin, where there have been no exploration drilling, there is limited interest in future near-term leasing and exploration opportunities in the Bering Sea OCS.  The MMS environmental studies effort has been significantly reduced in the Bering Sea, with the exception of completion of certain studies and monitoring of protected species as part of other ongoing studies.",

This work was primarily undertaken by the Laboratory of Applied Biocenology (I.e. ecology) and the Laboratory of Research of Plankton of Far-Eastern Seas.  Ecosystem investigations were included as part of fishery research and were supported by a research vessel.  The mission of the first expedition in 1983 was conducted until 1985, with pelagic surveys starting after 1986.  Eleven expeditions have been completed.",

Data collected include surface total carbon dioxide, alkalinity, nutrients, chlorophyll a, carbon-13 in seawater, and atmospheric carbon-13. Underway measurements include position, time, temperature and salinity. Skaugran samples and data were collected 3-4 times daily by scientific staff and once daily by ship`s engineers until 1999, then were reduced to daily engineer`s samples. Alligator Hope samples were collected 3 times daily.",

            "description": "Bristol Bay is considered a nursery area for Pacific halibut and was closed to\n     commercial halibut fishing from 1967 to 1989. In the summer of 1987 the\n     International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) conducted a survey in\n     Bristol Bay to assess the commercial stock size of halibut and the incidence of\n     sublegal fish. Three vessels fished the coastal area from Cape Newenham to\n     Cape Seniavin. The catch per unit effort was 6 pounds, well below the catch\n     per unit effort observed in other areas of the Bering Sea. The catch of\n     sublegal halibut was low; less than 0.5 halibut per unit effort. The survey\n     results suggested that a limited commercial fishery in Bristol Bay would not\n     have an adverse impact on juvenile stocks. The IPHC extended the regulatory\n     Area 4E boundary to allow commercial fishing in Bristol Bay in 1990. Fishing\n     success has been poor compared to other areas and the number of vessels\n     reporting landings in the fishery decreased from 97 in 1990 to 19 in 1992.\n     Annual Bristol Bay catches have ranged from 14,000 to 26,000 pounds.",

            "description": "New experiments are reported that extend previous studies of the internally generated variability found when the Hamburg LSG Ocean General Circulation Model is integrated under mixed  boundary conditions. All model integrations have stochastic forcing added to the freshwater flux to  excite the variability. It is demonstrated that the salinity anomalies that propagate around the meridional circulation of the Atlantic Ocean are merely signals emitted from the source of the variability in the Southern Ocean; they do not play an active role in its generation. It is the Southern Ocean flip\uff96flop oscillator, as suggested by a previous study, that is the driving mechanism of the 320-yr period oscillations. A second mode of propagation is identified that may be related to the\nperiodicity of the oscillations: westward propagation of upper-ocean salinity anomalies around the coast of Antarctica. It is shown that this mode is driven by the same density-upwelling wave motion as reported elsewhere in the literature.\n\n       The sensitivity of the simulated variability to changes in some of the model\uff92s numerical and physical algorithms is investigated. The computationally expensive step of retriangularizing the  matrix equation for the barotropic velocity can be done very infrequently without affecting the characteristics of the variability. Changing to a connective overturn parameterization that leaves  fewer residual instabilities has a small effect on the variability, while changing to one that mixes,  rather than interchanges, statically unstable water masses can reduce the magnitude of the  variability by up to 70%. The latter change, however, is attributed entirely to the different  freshwater flux forcing that the new parameterization implies. Using a more realistic haline and\nthermal coupling between sea ice and the ocean also leads to greatly reduced internal variability on  the 320-yr timescale. Again, changes in surface fluxes implied by the alteration to the model are important, and these changes have implications for the flux adjustments necessary when the LSG  model is coupled to an atmosphere model. The results presented here indicate considerable scope for reducing such flux adjustments.",

The contaminant of greatest concern is mercury (Hg), in light of the high levels of this element reported in some marine sediments and organisms of the sea and contiguous fluvial estuaries. We hypothesize that several unique environmental conditions, coupled with high natural supply of terrigenous Hg, result in high bioaccumulation of this element in marine organisms of the Bering Sea region with ultimate potential risk to commercial and subsistence users.  The primary objective of the study is to check whether the concentrations of Hg in some commercial and subsistence organisms in the Bering Sea are at levels that pose a risk to the organisms and are unacceptable for human consumption. To fulfill this objective we will analyze the concentrations of total Hg [Hg(t)] and its more toxic form, methylmercury (MeHg), in\nselected commercial and subsistence organisms of the Bering Sea (salmon, king crab, and clams). This study deals with issues considered a high priority by the Bering Sea Marine Research Plan (1998) as well as by several state and federal agencies and Bering Sea native groups.\n\nThis project also includes;\n\nJohn Kelley \nSchool of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences\n245 O'Neill Building\nUniversity of Alaska Fairbanks\nFairbanks, AK 99775-7220\n\nAn NPMR project",

We plan to place two closely spaced moorings on the shelf of the Gulf of Alaska about 60 km offshore of Seward. One mooring will monitor temperature, salinity and horizontal velocities, and the other will monitor surface meteorological conditions, nitrate levels, sinking particulate matter, fluorescence and light levels. This study, in conjunction with the present GLOBEC monitoring study in the Gulf of Alaska, will permit us to understand the relation between physical forcing and higher trophic levels (marine mammals, birds, and fish).\n\nThis project also includes;\n\nSusan Henrichs \nUniversity of Alaska Fairbanks\n\nTerry Whitledge\nUniversity of Alaska Fairbanks\n\nAn NPMR project",

            "description": "The Bering Sea responds strongly to major changes in atmospheric forcing. This response is vividly illustrated by the record warm sea surface temperatures that occurred in summer 1997, and the strong mixing in spring 1998. The spring 1998 mixing was due to intense storminess after nearly a decade of reduced storm activity. A large part of this variability is associated with large-scale atmospheric teleconnection modes that fluctuate on monthly to decadal time scales. The modes of particular importance to the Bering Sea during the cool season are the Pacific-North American pattern (PNA) and the Arctic  Oscillation (AO). The AO is receiving great interest because its persistent phase since about 1989 may be related to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases. Less work has been done on the atmospheric variability during the biologically active warm season, but one mode, the North Pacific pattern (NP), seems to be\nespecially important to the Bering Sea. The NP undergoes considerable decadal variability and appears to be linked to ENSO.   The goal of our work is to establish the dynamic relationships between the large-scale changes in the climate system (as\nencapsulated by the teleconnection indices) and the high-frequency, local forcing of the Bering Sea, especially with regard to sea ice, ocean transport and mixed-layer ocean\nprocesses. This research relies upon the daily data available from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis for the period 1958 to the present. Our work will reveal the extent to which air-sea interactions in the Bering Sea are predictable, and the probable changes in these\nair-sea interactions that accompany shifts in the climate system.  Our results will provide a firm climate context for the further study of historical changes in biological populations.\n\nAn NPMR project",

            "description": "We seek understanding of the dynamic response of the Gulf of Alaska shelf to a distributed coastal buoyancy influx and downwelling winds. Simple process-type numerical models will be used to resolve the basic dynamic balances and capture the\ncross-shelf circulation pattern. Parameter ranges used in modeling will encompass  seasonal variations in winds, buoyancy, and stratification of the Alaska Coastal Current (ACC). Results should shed light on a number of issues relevant to\nthe ecosystems of the Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea. We seek to provide a physical explanation for the observed high biological productivity of this deep shelf. The basis for this production is enigmatic given that downwelling winds prevail throughout most of the year and that the shelf receives a massive coastal influx of nutrient-poor freshwater. The ACC appears to be a crucial habitat for young-of-the-year salmon migrating to the ocean. Physical processes within the ACC could enhance the aggregation of zooplankton and therefore be critical to salmon recruitment success. Passive tracers will be introduced into the model to mimic zooplankton and/or young-of-the-year salmon. The dispersion of these tracers will show how these organisms are either retained within the ACC or dispersed outside this current. The results should benefit fisheries biologists seeking to understand salmon  recruitment processes that depends upon survival during their first year. Finally, the ACC plays a crucial role in the freshwater balance of the Gulf of Alaska and possibly the Bering Sea shelf, which lies downstream of the Gulf of Alaska and ultimately receives the ACC. The major focus of the proposed work is on the processes that control the along- and cross-shore transport of freshwater and, conversely, the onshore transport of nutrient-rich, high salinity water from offshore.\n\nThis work will be performed by a graduate student (William J. Williams).\n\nAn NPMR project",

            "description": "The southeastern Bering Sea shelf is an economically and ecologically important ecosystem subject to considerable natural variability. This variability influences the magnitude of primary production and its vertical and horizontal distribution which, in turn, influences the productivity of higher trophic levels over a large range of temporal and spatial scales. Nutrients are vital to maintain the elevated biomass observed on the shelf and must be continually injected into the euphotic zone to counter losses of phytoplankton to grazing, advection and burial. We focus here on exploring physical processes at the shelf edge and outer shelf, particularly instabilities and eddies in the Bering Slope Current that result in the advection of nutrient rich waters onto the shelf. While such processes have been observed to occur, their impact on the Bering Sea shelf ecosystem has yet to be described.\n\nWe will use altimeter data from remote sensing to describe mesoscale circulation variability and to identify episodic events of onshelf flow. Satellite tracked drifters will be released to monitor currents and the temporal evolution of ocean color along the slope. One sampling expedition per year for two years will provide detailed information on the dynamics of the Bering Slope Current/Aleutian North Slope Current (BSC/ANSC) system and on bio-optical relationships between phytoplankton biomass and ocean color. Finally, the stability of the BSC/ANSC system will be examined using an analytical, jet-turning-a-corner model. This research will provide collaborating researchers a regional\ncontext within which to interpret contemporaneous drifter, hydrographic, biological, and bio-optical data acquired from the shelf/slope region of the southeastern Bering Sea.\n\nThis project also includes;\n\nEdward Cokelet \nPacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, NOAA \n7600 Sand Point Way NE\nSeattle, WA 98115\ncokelet@pmel.noaa.gov\n\nTerry Whitledge \nUniversity of Alaska Fairbanks \n\nStephen Okkonen \nUniversity of Alaska Fairbanks\n\nAn NPMR project",

The method has\nnumerous advantages over other more common approaches that use ratios of stable isotopes and stomach content analyses. It will test hypotheses presented in the ReFER (Regime Forcing and Ecosystem Response) conceptual model that diets of populations\nof conspecific seabirds differ between oceanic and shelf habitats and that differences in diet account for opposite trends in abundance at the Pribilof Islands (shelf habitat) compared to Bogoslof Island (oceanic habitat). As part of the study, we will develop an inventory of fatty acid profiles of key forage species in the region that will be useful for diet studies of not only seabirds, but of trophically related marine mammals including sea lions, fur seals, and harbor seals. We will develop a protocol for obtaining biopsy samples of live birds, reducing their mortality rates from diet research.",

            "description": "The recent theoretical approach of Visbeck, Marshall, and Jones is used to examine shallow convection and offshore transport of dense water from an idealized coastal polynya. A constant  negative buoyancy flux is applied in a half-elliptical region adjacent to a coastal boundary, surrounded by a forcing decay region with uniform width W over which the imposed buoyancy flux decreases smoothly to zero. Initially, the density beneath the forcing increases linearly with time. A  baroclinically unstable front forms at the edge of the forcing region. The width of the front is  imposed by the width of the forcing decay region, provided this distance is larger than the  baroclinic Rossby radius. Baroclinic eddies, whose velocities are inversely proportional to W,  develop along the front and exchange dense water from the forcing region with ambient water,\neventually reaching an equilibrium in which the lateral buoyancy flux by eddies balances the prescribed surface buoyancy flux. The time to reach equilibrium te and the equilibrium density  anomaly e are given by where B0 is the imposed buoyancy flux, b the offshore width of the constant forcing region, H the  water depth, f the Coriolis parameter, 0 a reference density, and g the gravitational acceleration.  Finally,  = [/2E(1  b2/a2)]1/2, where a is the length of the constant forcing region along the  coast,  is the efficiency of eddy exchange, and E is the complete elliptic integral of the second\n kind. These parameter dependencies are fundamentally different from previous results for deep or shallow convection (1/2 power rather than 1/3 or 2/3) owing to the influence of the forcing decay  region. The scalings are confirmed with numerical calculations using a primitive equation model.  Eddy exchange in shallow convection is several times more efficient than in open-ocean deep convection. Some implications for Arctic coastal polynyas are discussed",

            "description": "The standard model for sea ice dynamics treats the ice pack as a visco\uff96plastic\nmaterial that flows plastically under typical stress conditions but behaves as a linear\nviscous fluid where strain rates are small and the ice becomes nearly rigid. Because of\nlarge viscosities in these regions, implicit numerical methods are necessary for time\nsteps larger than a few seconds. Current solution methods for these equations use\niterative relaxation methods, which are time consuming, scale poorly with mesh\nresolution, and are not well adapted to parallel computation. To remedy this, the\nauthors developed and tested two separate methods. First, by demonstrating that the\nviscous-plastic rheology can be represented by a symmetric, negative definite matrix\noperator, the much faster and better behaved preconditioned conjugate gradient\nmethod was implemented. Second, realizing that only the response of the ice on\ntimescales associated with wind forcing need be accurately resolved, the model was\nmodified so that it reduces to the viscous-plastic model at these timescales, whereas\nat shorter timescales the adjustment process takes place by a numerically more\nefficient elastic wave mechanism. This modification leads to a fully explicit numerical\nscheme that further improves the model\uff92s computational efficiency and is a great\nadvantage for implementations on parallel machines.\n\nFurthermore, it is observed that the standard viscous-plastic model has poor\ndynamic response to forcing on a daily timescale, given the standard time step (1 day)\nused by the ice modeling community. In contrast, the explicit discretization of the\nelastic wave mechanism allows the elastic-viscous-plastic model to capture the ice\nresponse to variations in the imposed stress more accurately. Thus, the\nelastic-viscous-plastic model provides more accurate results for shorter timescales\nassociated with physical forcing, reproduces viscous-plastic model behavior on longer\ntimescales, and is computationally more efficient overall.",

During these observations several corals were collected and three colonies were made available for an age and growth study.  The colonies examined in this study were identified as bubblegum coral (Paragorgia sp.), precious pink coral (Corallium sp.), and bamboo coral (Keratoisis sp.).  Age was estimated from growth zone counts made in skeletal cross sections.  These age estimages were used to estimate growth rates, and ultimately colony age and perhaps longevity.  To validate the growth rate estimate from growth zone counts a radiometric method called a lead-210 dating was used to determine an independent growth rate for each colony.  Agreement of growth rates derived from growth zone counts and lead-210 dating were used as an indicator of age estimate accruacy.  Growth rates determined for each species were quire different.  The bubblegum coral had a relatively high growth rate, with the precious pink coral being somewhat intermediate and the bamboo coral being the slowest growing\n\n[ Co-PIs: Gregor M.

            "description": "A prominent year-round ensemble response to a global sea surface\n     temperature (SST) anomaly field fixed to that for January 1992 (near the\n     peak of a major warm El Ni\ufff1o\uff96Southern Oscillation episode) was observed\n     in a 20-yr integration of the general circulation model used for operational\n     seasonal prediction by the U.S. National Weather Service. This motivated a\n     detailed observational reassessment of the teleconnections between strong\n     SST anomalies in the central equatorial Pacific Ocean and Pacific\uff96North\n     America region 700-hPa heights and U.S. surface temperatures and\n     precipitation. The approach used consisted of formation of monthly mean\n     composites formed separately from cases in which the SST anomaly in a key\n     area of the central equatorial Pacific Ocean was either large and positive or\n     large and negative. Extensive permutation tests were conducted to test null\n     hypotheses of no signal in these composites. The results provided a\n     substantial case for the presence of teleconnections to either the positive- or\n     negative-SST anomalies in every month of the year. These signals were\n     seasonally varying (sometimes with substantial month to month changes) and,\n     when present for both SST-anomaly signs in a particular month, usually were\n     not similarly phased patterns of opposite polarity (i.e., the SST\uff96teleconnected\n     variable relationships were most often nonlinear).\n\n       A suite of 13 45-yr integrations of the same model described above was\n     run with global SST analyses reconstructed from the observational record.\n     Corresponding composites from the model were formed and compared\n     visually and quantitatively with the high-confidence observational signals. The\n     quantitative comparisons included skill analyses utilizing a decomposition that\n     relates the squared differences between two maps to phase correspondence\n     and amplitude and bias error terms and analyses of the variance about\n     composite means. For the latter, in the case of the model runs it was possible\n     to estimate the portions of this variance attributable to case to case variation\n     in SSTs and to internal variability. Comparisons to monthly mean maps and\n     analyses of variance for the 20-yr run with SSTs fixed to January 1992 values\n     were also made.\n\n       The visual and quantitative comparisons all revealed different aspects of\n     prominent model systematic errors that have important implications for the\n     optimum exploitation of the model for use in prediction. One of these\n     implications was that the current model\uff92s ensemble responses to SST forcing\n     will not be optimally useful until after nonlinear correction of\n     SST-field-dependent systematic errors.

            "description": "A dynamic-thermodynamic sea ice model is developed and coupled with\n     the Melbourne University general circulation model to simulate the seasonal\n     cycle of the Antarctic sea ice distribution. The model is efficient, rapid to\n     compute, and useful for a range of climate studies. The thermodynamic part\n     of the sea ice model is similar to that developed by Parkinson and\n     Washington, the dynamics contain a simplified ice rheology that resists\n     compression. The thermodynamics is based on energy conservation at the top\n     surface of the ice/snow, the ice/water interface, and the open water area to\n     determine the ice formation, accretion, and ablation. A lead parameterization\n     is introduced with an effective partitioning scheme for freezing between and\n     under the ice floes. The dynamic calculation determines the motion of ice,\n     which is forced with the atmospheric wind, taking account of ice resistance\n     and rafting. The simulated sea ice distribution compares reasonably well with\n     observations. The seasonal cycle of ice extent is well simulated in phase as\n     well as in magnitude. Simulated sea ice thickness and concentration are also\n     in good agreement with observations over most regions and serve to indicate\n     the importance of advection and ocean drift in the determination of the sea ice\n     distribution.",

            "description": "A global analysis of in situ observations of sea surface temperature (SST)\n     developed for use at the Canadian Meteorological Center is described. The\n     analysis is done on the anomaly, the departure from Climatology. The anomaly\n     plus Climatology, or resulting SST, is used as the lower boundary condition by\n     the numerical weather prediction model. Since there is no ocean model to\n     provide a background or first-guess field for the analysis, and since anomalies\n     are observed to persist over long periods, the background field is obtained\n     essentially by assuming persistence of the previous anomaly. The analysis\n     algorithm is statistical interpolation. Attention is focused on techniques to\n     control the quality of the observations, including a technique to remove\n     systematic errors from ship observations. The analysis resolution is 0.9\u00b0 and\n     the correlation e-folding distance is 212 km. Verification of the analysis is\n     presented using independent data from buoys and expendable\n     bathy-thermographs for a one-year period. Verification is also presented for\n     the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP, Washington)\n     weekly analysis and for Climatology. Results indicate that the analysis has skill\n     over Climatology in all regions and skill over the NCEP weekly analysis in the\n     North Atlantic. In the rest of the Northern Hemisphere, analysis error\n     estimates for the two analyses are similar, while in the Southern Hemisphere\n     the NCEP analysis is superior, probably due to its use of satellite data. It is\n     intended that this analysis will be an essential component of a debiasing\n     algorithm for satellite SST observations.",

            "description": "Like tree rings, the growth increments in the axial rod of sea pens may reflect long time series of environmental influence. An axial rod is the simple, unbranched endoskeleton of sea pens, which are octocorals that occur in all oceans from shallow to abyssal depths. The formation of these increments, however, is not well described. Twelve rods were extracted from sea pen colonies collected in the Bering Sea. Colonies were selected by total length: 25-29 cm, 99-124 cm, and 153-167 cm. First, rod growth was hypothesized from rod morphology and internal microstructure. Rod shape did not change with overall size suggesting isometric growth. Examination of the internal microstructure, however, suggested that colonies burrow deeper into the sediment with age so that the first-formed part of the calcified rod is at or near the base. Recent accretions likely cover all but the basal end of the rod. Thus, simple transverse sections taken just above the base, to avoid rugose material, should reveal most of the colony\uff92s growth history. Second, the number of growth increments, each comprised of a translucent and opaque zone, was found to vary with rod length, position along the rod, and magnification. At 16x, these increments averaged 0.08 mm (\uffb1 0.005 SE). However, at 100x, it was evident that each \uff93increment\uff94 was actually comprised of finer, c. 0.03-mm wide, increments. Higher magnification did not reveal any further nesting. The maximum number of increments was 132. Finally, an attempt was made to determine the temporal periodicity of growth zone interpretations, the decay of 210Pb over the length of a colony was analyzed. Lead-210 activities in a series of cores extracted from locations along the axial rod ranged from 0.691 \uffb1 0.036 to 2.76 \uffb1 0.13 dpm/g. Because 210Pb activity did not follow a pattern of decay over the length of the colony, a growth rate and corresponding age could not be determined.  \n\n[ An NPMR project ]  [ Co-PIs: Gregor M.

            "description": "To date, most lower trophic level research on the eastern Bering Sea shelf has concentrated on the role of the spring diatom bloom as the main annual production event. Over the Middle Shelf Domain, primary and secondary productions occur throughout the summer supported by regenerated nutrients. During this period, standing stock of chlorophyll is relatively low (0.5 - 2 \u00b5g/l). Periodic outbreaks of diatoms can occur in response to erosion of the pycnocline and injection of nitrate and silicate into the surface waters. Between these outbreaks, nano- and microzooplankton (<200 \u00b5m) are hypothesized to dominate nutrient cycling. During these periods microzooplankton may also provide the intermediary link between small flagellated primary producers and food for juvenile fishes. Recent recurring \"blooms\"\nof the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi require us to achieve a better understanding of summertime nutrient recycling and trophic transfer so that we can predict the effect, if any, E. huxleyi will have on higher trophic levels. We plan to dissect the summer pelagic food web and nutrient cycle of the Middle Shelf Domain to determine the relative contribution of microzooplankton to these processes. Specifically we will investigate nutrient cycling and trophic transfer during two distinct phytoplankton communities: small flagellates (coccolithophores or other species) and diatoms. Juvenile Pollock, a nodal species in the Bering Sea ecosystem, forage on particle-grazing mesozooplankton and variations in summer food supply may affect their ability to accumulate energy stores for the harsh Subarctic winters.\n\nThis project also includes;\n\nEvelyn Lessard \nUniversity of Washington \n\nJeffrey Napp \nAlaska Fisheries Science Center, NOAA \n7600 Sand Point Way NE\nSeattle, WA  98115\njeff.napp@noaa.gov\nAn NPMR project",

            "description": "To date, most lower trophic level research on the eastern Bering Sea shelf has concentrated on the role of the spring diatom bloom as the main annual production event. Over the Middle Shelf Domain, primary and secondary productions occur\nthroughout the summer supported by regenerated nutrients. During this period, standing stock of chlorophyll is relatively low (0.5 - 2 \u00b5g/l). Periodic outbreaks of diatoms can occur in response to erosion of the pycnocline and injection of nitrate and silicate\ninto the surface waters. Between these outbreaks, nano- and microzooplankton (<200 \u00b5m) are hypothesized to dominate nutrient cycling. During these periods microzooplankton may also provide the intermediary link between small flagellated primary producers and food for juvenile fishes. Recent recurring \"blooms\"\nof the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi require us to achieve a better understanding of summertime nutrient recycling and trophic transfer so that we can predict the effect, if any, E. huxleyi will have on higher trophic levels. We plan to dissect the summer pelagic food web and nutrient cycle of the Middle Shelf Domain to determine the relative\ncontribution of microzooplankton to these processes. Specifically we will investigate nutrient cycling and trophic transfer during two distinct phytoplankton communities: small flagellates (coccolithophores or other species) and diatoms. Juvenile Pollock, a nodal species in the Bering Sea ecosystem, forage on particle-grazing mesozooplankton and variations in summer food supply may affect their ability to accumulate energy stores for the harsh Subarctic winters.\n\nThis project also includes;\n\nEvelyn Lessard \nUniversity of Washington \n\nJeffrey Napp \nAlaska Fisheries Science Center, NOAA \n7600 Sand Point Way NE\nSeattle, WA  98115\njeff.napp@noaa.gov\nAn NPMR project",

Strong year classes and above-average survival occurred for many commercially important species all along the west coast of Canada and the United States. Trends in total salmon catches increased primarily from increased salmon production in Alaska. Some stocks of maturing pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha), Coho (O. kisutch), and Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) also had above-average growth in 1977.

            "description": "Our objective is to put in place a monitoring program for the eastern North Pacific and southern Bering Sea region. Large scale changes in Pacific salmon populations in all regions of North America have been related to climate change in this century. The likely initial cause is changes in the structure of the ocean and atmosphere. These changes are known to affect the abundance, productivity, and community structure of continental shelf and open ocean plankton communities. Changes in plankton\nabundance have been related to the changes in salmon abundance, and reduced ocean productivity is probably the causal link leading to poor ocean survival for salmon.\nClimate changes experienced in recent years are consistent with expectations from models for early stages of global warming. In all regions of the West Coast of North America there have been extremely sudden changes in the productivity of salmon populations. These changes have not been expected from the standard fisheries management theories, nor could they be forecast from available data. However, the changes have had devastating economic impacts on coastal communities from Oregon to (most recently) Alaska. The pattern of failure in year-class strength of Bristol Bay\nsockeye salmon and other stocks and species demonstrates that the cause of the\nsudden downturn has in large part a marine origin. However, salmon spend part of their life history in both coastal and oceanic marine environments, and are therefore subject to environmental changes occurring in both regions. \n\nWe seek to put in place a monitoring framework using the Hardy Continuous  Plankton Recorder (CPR). This is an established technology widely used in the North Atlantic. The\nchanges that the Atlantic CPR program have documented in the 1990s are now being linked to the decline in Atlantic salmon populations, that are also experiencing substantially increased ocean mortality.\n\nOur project involves sampling of the plankton in multiple regions of the offshore and coastal regions of the eastern North Pacific and southern Bering Sea. The monitoring lines will (a) sample the plankton along the coastal migration routes of the juvenile salmon in four locations, (b) quantify the distribution and abundance of shelf plankton populations in the Atlantic (Steele 1998; the relationship of shelf to offshore populations is unclear in the Pacific because of a lack of data), and (c) permit cross-comparisons with almost all existing eastern Pacific ocean surveys (CalCOFI in California; Line P in Canada; and GAK-1 near Seward, Alaska).\n\nThis project also includes; Dr. Sonia Batten, Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science, 1 Walker Terrace, The Hoe, Plymouth, United Kingdom PL1 3BN,\n44 1752 221-112\nsoba@wpo.nerc.ac.uk\nAn NPMR project",

Two existing ship time commitments in the summer of 1999 will be used to undertake the field research with follow-up laboratory analyses in 1999-2000. Based upon recent work, we expect that sediment-based processes can directly decrease concentrations of nitrate in overlying waters on large, shallow shelves. For example, in a paper recently published in the Journal of Geophysical Research (Vol. 104: 7827-7836, April 15, 1999), we provide evidence that 5 to 20% of nitrate currently brought onto the northern Bering Shelf may be lost through denitrification before export off the shelf in the Chukchi Sea. This sediment-based process therefore can have a significant impact on overall ecosystem fertility, and directly impact the biomass of higher trophic levels sequestered within commercially important fisheries and marine mammal populations utilized for subsistence.  The development of spatially extensive estimates of denitrification rates on the Bering continental shelf will improve our understanding of overall carbon and nitrogen cycling in the productive water, and therefore contribute to the North Pacific Marine Research program's goals of developing predictive capabilities for ecological response to expected global change.

            "description": "Our objective is to put in place a monitoring program for the eastern North Pacific and southern Bering Sea region. Large scale changes in Pacific salmon populations in all regions of North America have been related to climate change in this century. The likely initial cause is changes in the structure of the ocean and atmosphere. These changes are known to affect the abundance, productivity, and community structure of continental shelf and open ocean plankton communities. Changes in plankton\nabundance have been related to the changes in salmon abundance, and reduced ocean productivity is probably the causal link leading to poor ocean survival for salmon.\nClimate changes experienced in recent years are consistent with expectations from models for early stages of global warming. In all regions of the West Coast of North America there have been extremely sudden changes in the productivity of salmon populations. These changes have not been expected from the standard fisheries management theories, nor could they be forecast from available data. However, the changes have had devastating economic impacts on coastal communities from Oregon to (most recently) Alaska. The pattern of failure in year-class strength of Bristol Bay\nsockeye salmon and other stocks and species demonstrates that the cause of the\nsudden downturn has in large part a marine origin. However, salmon spend part of their life history in both coastal and oceanic marine environments, and are therefore subject to environmental changes occurring in both regions. \n\nWe seek to put in place a monitoring framework using the Hardy Continuous  Plankton Recorder (CPR). This is an established technology widely used in the North Atlantic. The\nchanges that the Atlantic CPR program have documented in the 1990s are now being linked to the decline in Atlantic salmon populations, that are also experiencing substantially increased ocean mortality.\n\nOur project involves sampling of the plankton in multiple regions of the offshore and coastal regions of the eastern North Pacific and southern Bering Sea. The monitoring lines will (a) sample the plankton along the coastal migration routes of the juvenile salmon in four locations, (b) quantify the distribution and abundance of shelf plankton populations in the Atlantic (Steele 1998; the relationship of shelf to offshore populations is unclear in the Pacific because of a lack of data), and (c) permit cross-comparisons with almost all existing eastern Pacific ocean surveys (CalCOFI in California; Line P in Canada; and GAK-1 near Seward, Alaska).\n\nThis project also includes; Dr. Sonia Batten, Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science, 1 Walker Terrace, The Hoe, Plymouth, United Kingdom PL1 3BN,\n44 1752 221-112\nsoba@wpo.nerc.ac.uk\nAn NPMR project",

The U.S. Congress intends that NPMR studies lead to greater understanding of ecosystem dynamics in the North Pacific Ocean, and the transfer of useful findings to people and groups who have an economic, social, or moral stake in the long-term health of the region. Users of the\ninformation include the scientific community, policy makers, resource managers, marine industries (especially the commercial fishing industry), conservationists, subsistence users, and the general public.  Part one of this project is a 12-installment radio series based on NPMR areas of study. The series will be broadcast on Alaska Public Radio stations and on other broadcast outlets in and outside Alaska. The stories will explain key physical, chemical, and biological phenomena in the ecosystem to provide the public with a good understanding of the basic make-up and dynamics of the North Pacific ecosystem. Possible subjects include the effect of the ice edge on primary production, the effect of sea surface temperature on selected marine animals,\ncirculation and upwelling patterns and their effects on commercially important fish and shellfish, the relationship between climate change and the ecology of marine mammals, and Native perspectives on how specific components of the ecosystem have appeared\nto have changed over the past half century. Each of the 12 radio segments will be 5 minutes long and include high quality digitized sound effects recorded in the field, and first-person interviews with NPMR scientists. Part two of this project will be a classroom guide to the Bering Sea, aimed at junior high/high school level students and teachers. The book will include information covered by the radio series, augmented by additional text, color photos, various figures such as maps and information graphics, and color\nillustrations of North Pacific marine plants and animals and their habitats. The book will include an index of terms and place names, and a glossary of terms.\n\nhttp://www2.sfos.uaf.edu:8080/npmr/projects/data/124/project124.html\n\n\nhttp://www.uaf.edu/seagrant\n\nAn NPMR project",

            "description": "This two-part project will inform the public about NPMR through a radio series about the Bering Sea and a high school/junior high level classroom reference guide to the Bering Sea, both based on NPMR areas of study. The U.S. Congress intends that NPMR studies lead to greater understanding of ecosystem dynamics in the North Pacific Ocean, and the transfer of useful findings to people and groups who have an economic, social, or moral stake in the long-term health of the region. Users of the\ninformation include the scientific community, policy makers, resource managers, marine industries (especially the commercial fishing industry), conservationists, subsistence users, and the general public.  Part one of this project is a 12-installment radio series based on NPMR areas of study. The series will be broadcast on Alaska Public Radio stations and on other broadcast outlets in and outside Alaska. The stories will explain key physical, chemical, and biological phenomena in the ecosystem to provide the public with a good understanding of the basic make-up and dynamics of the North Pacific ecosystem. Possible subjects include the effect of the ice edge on primary production, the effect of sea surface temperature on selected marine animals,\ncirculation and upwelling patterns and their effects on commercially important fish and shellfish, the relationship between climate change and the ecology of marine mammals, and Native perspectives on how specific components of the ecosystem have appeared\nto have changed over the past half century. Each of the 12 radio segments will be 5 minutes long and include high quality digitized sound effects recorded in the field, and first-person interviews with NPMR scientists. Part two of this project will be a classroom guide to the Bering Sea, aimed at junior high/high school level students and teachers. The book will include information covered by the radio series, augmented by additional text, color photos, various figures such as maps and information graphics, and color\nillustrations of North Pacific marine plants and animals and their habitats. The book will include an index of terms and place names, and a glossary of terms.\n\nhttp://www2.sfos.uaf.edu:8080/npmr/projects/data/124/project124.html\n\n\nhttp://www.uaf.edu/seagrant\n\nAn NPMR project",

The approach is a retrospective study of growth and survival of chum and pink salmon stocks from diverse locations including western Alaska. The operating hypothesis is that, because fluctuating ocean climate differs from\nwest to east in the historical record, salmon productivity (growth and survival) should also have varied concordantly, both in historical and spatial scales. Over thirty years of data suitable for testing this hypothesis and alternatives are available in archives of\nproduction statistics and scales. The method will entail retrospective time series analyses of salmon production and climate variation and will entail an analysis of spatial patterns of salmon production. Through this analysis we expect to identify factors affecting growth and survival of salmon from different parts of their range across the Subarctic Pacific.\n\nThis project also includes;\n\nWilliam Smoker \nUniversity of Alaska Fairbanks \n\nWilliam Heard \nAuke Bay Laboratory, Alaska Fisheries Science Center, NOAA \n\nPeter Hagen \nAlaska Department of Fish and Game \npeterh@adfg.state.ak.us\n\n\nCollaborators include Masahide Kaeriyama of Hokkaido Tokai\nUniversity, and Leonid Klyashtorin, VINRO, Russian Federation.\nAn NPMR project",

The results of this study are designed to supplement new and ongoing research in the Bering Sea and North Pacific, addressing several of the NPMR issues including monitoring, forage fish and apex community ecology, and effects of climate change on the biology of the systems. This study falls in the categories of remote sensing and field studies.\n\nA lidar produces short pulses of laser light which pass through the water's  surface and reflect off biological features in the water column, and processes the returning signal. When mounted along with a video camera in a down-looking configuration from the\nbelly of an aircraft, we can use the combined data to produce a three dimensional array of the biological features. When conducted over ground survey transects that include\noceanography, net catches, acoustics, and bird and mammal counts, the processed lidar and video images can be properly interpreted and related to ocean conditions. We propose to overfly ground survey transects, collect continuous spatial data within each\ntransect, and replicate the surveys both during the day and at night. We plan to conduct these surveys synoptic with ongoing ground survey programs (including Inner Fronts, US GLOBEC and/or Ocean Carrying Capacity).\n\nThis technique could overcome many of the shortcomings of traditionally applied technology. \nThose include: \n1) the lack of spatial resolution, \n2) difficulty in performing synoptic data collection, \n3) a mismatch in comparing temporal and spatial scale (due to the speed of vessels versus the time frame of biological activity bursts or diurnal patterns), and \n4) high cost (ground surveys can be reduced). In California, lidar surveys have been\nevaluated for assessments of pelagic sardines and anchovy as a way to reduce the shipboard time involved due to the low relative cost of remote sensing at high speeds.\n\nIn order to fully evaluate this  technique in Alaskan waters, we intend to conduct surveys in two separate oceanographic regions, namely the Bering Sea and northern regions of the Pacific Ocean adjacent to the Alaskan coast. \n\nThis project also includes;\n\nBrenda Norcross \nUniversity of Alaska Fairbanks \n\nJames Churnside \nEnvironmental Technology Laboratory, NOAA\nAn NPMR project",

            "description": "We will conduct a pilot study on the use of airborne lidar (Light Detecting And Ranging) and 3-chip digital video to assess epipelagic biological features such as forage fish\nschools, zooplankton, large individual fish (e.g., salmon), marine mammals and seabirds. The results of this study are designed to supplement new and ongoing research in the Bering Sea and North Pacific, addressing several of the NPMR issues including monitoring, forage fish and apex community ecology, and effects of climate change on the biology of the systems. This study falls in the categories of remote sensing and field studies.\n\nA lidar produces short pulses of laser light which pass through the water's  surface and reflect off biological features in the water column, and processes the returning signal. When mounted along with a video camera in a down-looking configuration from the\nbelly of an aircraft, we can use the combined data to produce a three dimensional array of the biological features. When conducted over ground survey transects that include\noceanography, net catches, acoustics, and bird and mammal counts, the processed lidar and video images can be properly interpreted and related to ocean conditions. We propose to overfly ground survey transects, collect continuous spatial data within each\ntransect, and replicate the surveys both during the day and at night. We plan to conduct these surveys synoptic with ongoing ground survey programs (including Inner Fronts, US GLOBEC and/or Ocean Carrying Capacity).\n\nThis technique could overcome many of the shortcomings of traditionally applied technology. \nThose include: \n1) the lack of spatial resolution, \n2) difficulty in performing synoptic data collection, \n3) a mismatch in comparing temporal and spatial scale (due to the speed of vessels versus the time frame of biological activity bursts or diurnal patterns), and \n4) high cost (ground surveys can be reduced). In California, lidar surveys have been\nevaluated for assessments of pelagic sardines and anchovy as a way to reduce the shipboard time involved due to the low relative cost of remote sensing at high speeds.\n\nIn order to fully evaluate this  technique in Alaskan waters, we intend to conduct surveys in two separate oceanographic regions, namely the Bering Sea and northern regions of the Pacific Ocean adjacent to the Alaskan coast. \n\nThis project also includes;\n\nBrenda Norcross \nUniversity of Alaska Fairbanks \n\nJames Churnside \nEnvironmental Technology Laboratory, NOAA\nAn NPMR project",

            "description": "The Bering Sea supports the largest flatfish fishery in the United States. Productivity in this region is important to the U.S. economy; fisheries from the region constitute 10-40% of the U.S. fisheries harvest. Bottom trawling for flatfish has been common in the Bering Sea since the early 1950s when foreign fishing vessels overexploited yellowfin sole stocks. Mobile fishing gear has recently become the focus of international attention as\nmanagers fear habitat degradation, loss of biological diversity and the subsequent consequences to fishery resources. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSFCMA) requires the identification and description of Essential\nFish Habitat (EFH) for each commercially fished species and any adverse impacts that may affect EFH. However, a paucity of knowledge on trawl impacts on the eastern Bering Sea shelf currently impedes resource managers' ability to address the\nrequirements of the MSFCMA and make informed decisions in this region. \n\nIn collaboration with the Alaska Fisheries Science Center of the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service, and the Groundfish Forum, we will determine if there are measurable impacts of commercial flatfish trawling on EFH of the eastern Bering Sea shelf. \nOur objectives are to 1) compare physical and biological variables between trawled areas and closures to determine chronic impacts 2) conduct experimental trawling in selected closures to determine acute trawling impacts by comparing physical and biological variables 3) determine the severity of trawl impacts compared to natural variation at different depths and substrates across the eastern Bering Sea shelf. \n\nThis project also includes; Sue Hills,  University of Alaska Fairbanks,  P.O.

            "description": "This project addresses the need to integrate top trophic-level predators into interdisciplinary mesoscale and fine-scale process studies of middle trophic levels in the southeast Bering Sea. In collaboration with physical, chemical and biological sampling within the Fisheries-Oceanography Coordinated Investigations (FOCI) and the Midwater Assessment and Conservation Engineering Program (MACE), our survey will provide data to define trophic linkages between middle and upper trophic levels, specifically cetaceans, contributing to effects on community structure and function. Results will define top-down and bottom-up interactions, especially in regard to euphausiids\n(Thysanoessa inermis and T. raschii) and copepods (e.g., Neocalanus cristatus, Neocalanus plumchrus, and Calanus marshallae) which are important forage for upper trophic level predators. Information on the spatial distributions of whales, and estimates of feeding rates, relative to interannual variability in the productivity and physical forcing in the system, will be used to estimate rates of energy transfer upward from middle trophic levels. Models of trophic interactions and carbon flow within the systems will greatly benefit from these data. Predation may also be a factor that explains swarming and schooling of zooplankton and fish, thus further explaining discontinuities of prey distributions. Finally, in addition to the mesoscale survey, we will focus specific sampling and foraging aggregations of whales, which act as natural integrative plankton recorders. Our survey defines mesoscale variability in zooplankton biomass across the shelf from the shelf-edge to the Inner Front. From the bottom-up perspective, we propose to test the hypothesis that physical processes and variation in prey density do not affect the occurrence patterns of top trophic level predators in the southeast Bering Sea shelf; or that there is no threshold of prey density that can just be reached before the distribution of predators is affected. Alternately, from the top-down perspective,\nwe hypothesize that average swarm/school characteristics, as assessed by acoustic and net sampling (i.e. size, depth, density, shape), remain the same regardless of densities and behavior of predators in the vicinity.    \n\n[ An NPMR project ]  [ Reference: Tynan, C.T. 2004.

            "description": "The population of the Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus), an apex predator in the North Pacific and Bering Sea ecosystems, has continuously declined over the past two\ndecades along the Aleutian Islands and in the Gulf of Alaska.  Steller sea lions are now listed as threatened within their eastern  Alaskan range, and as endangered in their western range, under the Endangered Species Act. Despite years of productive research,  little is known about the extent to which a hypothesized reduction in juvenile survival--in turn possibly related to reduced prey abundance--contributes to the present population trends.  We will accurately measure survival rates in juvenile Steller sea\nlions at two locations of a declining population, along the Aleutian Islands and in the Gulf of Alaska. For the first time, our approach will also deliver longitudinal dive effort data spanning several years, as well as detailed dive behavior data from non-surviving\nsea lions, and thus from the very animals that presumably contribute most to the population decline. Survival rates and long-term dive effort data will be determined through the use of satellite-linked mortality transmitters (SMXs), implanted into 60\nfreeranging young-of-the-year Steller sea lions. As a central part of our project, we will directly test the hypothesized reduction in juvenile Steller sea lion survival.  Our experimental design utilizes a new paradigm for testing additional specific hypotheses pertinent to the decline of Stellers: a previously impossible direct comparison between survivors and non-survivors. We will analyze the relationship between early body mass and condition, health, as well as pollution indicators,  near-weaning dive behavior and performance, continued long-term foraging effort and the survival of individual juvenile\nSteller sea lions. The analysis of seasonal, interannual and ontogenetic changes and variability in dive effort and mortality, as well as of detailed dive effort prior to death, will allow us to assess the relative effects of reduced foraging efficiency, nutritional\nstress, and possibly predation on survival. Furthermore, we will assess the extent to which juvenile survival can be predicted by parameters that can be measured in young Stellers prior to weaning. Such a predictive analysis might become a powerful tool\nin the assessment of future population trends before they become obvious at the population level. Our cooperative project--which integrates interdisciplinary research on population dynamics, foraging ecology, physiology, health, and contaminants--directly addresses key issues and implements specific recommendations of the Bering Sea\nEcosystem Research Plan Draft, the Steller Sea Lion Recovery Plan, several workshops on Steller sea lion issues, as well as NPMR. These diverse plans identify needs on Steller sea lion research, highlighting long-term longitudinal monitoring and\njuvenile survival as two of the most central and pressing issues.\n\nAn NPMR project",

Evidence suggests links between low juvenile survival and nutrient limitations (i.e. diets of low quantity, quality, and diversity). Diets of Steller sea lions are diverse and include species of primary and secondary importance to commercial fisheries in Alaska. Thus\nfishing activity in haulout areas is assumed to negatively effect the ability of Steller sea lions to secure food. Based primarily upon assumptions about Steller sea lion foraging behavior and prey/habitat use, the National Marine Fisheries Service recently implemented legislation that disallows trawl fishing in 10 nmi radii around Steller sea lion haulouts. We hypothesize that the relative composition and abundance of prey species in the diet of Steller sea lions is directly related to availability of prey around critical haulouts in the Kodiak area. The location of Kodiak Island is central to the decline in the number of Steller sea lions and the local fishing industry is greatly impacted by the newly imposed no-trawl \"buffer zones\" around Steller sea lion haulouts.  Our project involves determining seasonal Steller sea lion abundance, distribution (through monthly aerial surveys), and diet (through quarterly scat collection) in the Kodiak Island region. Simultaneously, we will determine temporal (seasonal and annual) and spatial (10 and 20 nmi) composition, abundance and distribution of prey around five critical haulouts on the eastern side of Kodiak Island. We will compare the use of prey by Steller sea lions to seasonal and annual availability of prey both inside and outside of the buffer zones. These data ultimately will be of practical importance to fisheries managers and will provide basic knowledge of predator/prey dynamics in the Kodiak Island region.\nThis project also includes;  Brenda Norcross, bnorcross@ims.uaf.edu; Sue Hills, shills@ims.uaf.edu;  Loren Buck, cbuck@uaf.edu, Robert Foy, foy@ims.uaf.edu\n\nAn NPMR project",

            "description": "The Bering Sea responds strongly to major changes in atmospheric forcing. This response is vividly illustrated by the record warm sea surface temperatures that occurred in summer 1997, and the strong mixing in spring 1998. The spring 1998 mixing was due to intense storminess after nearly a decade of reduced storm activity. A large part of this variability is associated with large-scale atmospheric teleconnection modes that fluctuate on monthly to decadal time scales. The modes of particular importance to the Bering Sea during the cool season are the Pacific-North American pattern (PNA) and the Arctic  Oscillation (AO). The AO is receiving great interest because its persistent phase since about 1989 may be related to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases. Less work has been done on the atmospheric variability during the biologically active warm season, but one mode, the North Pacific pattern (NP), seems to be\nespecially important to the Bering Sea. The NP undergoes considerable decadal variability and appears to be linked to ENSO.   The goal of our work is to establish the dynamic relationships between the large-scale changes in the climate system (as\nencapsulated by the teleconnection indices) and the high-frequency, local forcing of the Bering Sea, especially with regard to sea ice, ocean transport and mixed-layer ocean\nprocesses. This research relies upon the daily data available from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis for the period 1958 to the present. Our work will reveal the extent to which air-sea interactions in the Bering Sea are predictable, and the probable changes in these\nair-sea interactions that accompany shifts in the climate system.  Our results will provide a firm climate context for the further study of historical changes in biological populations.\n\nAn NPMR project",

Simple process-type numerical models will be used to resolve the basic dynamic balances and capture the\ncross-shelf circulation pattern. Parameter ranges used in modeling will encompass  seasonal variations in winds, buoyancy, and stratification of the Alaska Coastal Current (ACC). Results should shed light on a number of issues relevant to\nthe ecosystems of the Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea. We seek to provide a physical explanation for the observed high biological productivity of this deep shelf. The basis for this production is enigmatic given that downwelling winds prevail throughout most of the year and that the shelf receives a massive coastal influx of nutrient-poor freshwater. The ACC appears to be a crucial habitat for young-of-the-year salmon migrating to the ocean. Physical processes within the ACC could enhance the aggregation of zooplankton and therefore be critical to salmon recruitment success. Passive tracers will be introduced into the model to mimic zooplankton and/or young-of-the-year salmon. The dispersion of these tracers will show how these organisms are either retained within the ACC or dispersed outside this current. The results should benefit fisheries biologists seeking to understand salmon  recruitment processes that depends upon survival during their first year. Finally, the ACC plays a crucial role in the freshwater balance of the Gulf of Alaska and possibly the Bering Sea shelf, which lies downstream of the Gulf of Alaska and ultimately receives the ACC. The major focus of the proposed work is on the processes that control the along- and cross-shore transport of freshwater and, conversely, the onshore transport of nutrient-rich, high salinity water from offshore.\n\nThis work will be performed by a graduate student (William J.

Results should shed light on a number of issues relevant to\nthe ecosystems of the Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea. We seek to provide a physical explanation for the observed high biological productivity of this deep shelf. The basis for this production is enigmatic given that downwelling winds prevail throughout most of the year and that the shelf receives a massive coastal influx of nutrient-poor freshwater. The ACC appears to be a crucial habitat for young-of-the-year salmon migrating to the ocean. Physical processes within the ACC could enhance the aggregation of zooplankton and therefore be critical to salmon recruitment success. Passive tracers will be introduced into the model to mimic zooplankton and/or young-of-the-year salmon. The dispersion of these tracers will show how these organisms are either retained within the ACC or dispersed outside this current. The results should benefit fisheries biologists seeking to understand salmon  recruitment processes that depends upon survival during their first year. Finally, the ACC plays a crucial role in the freshwater balance of the Gulf of Alaska and possibly the Bering Sea shelf, which lies downstream of the Gulf of Alaska and ultimately receives the ACC. The major focus of the proposed work is on the processes that control the along- and cross-shore transport of freshwater and, conversely, the onshore transport of nutrient-rich, high salinity water from offshore.\n\nThis work will be performed by a graduate student (William J. Williams).\n\nAn NPMR project",

            "description": "The southeastern Bering Sea shelf is an economically and ecologically important ecosystem subject to considerable natural variability. This variability influences the magnitude of primary production and its vertical and horizontal distribution which, in turn, influences the productivity of higher trophic levels over a large range of temporal and spatial scales. Nutrients are vital to maintain the elevated biomass observed on the shelf and must be continually injected into the euphotic zone to counter losses of phytoplankton to grazing, advection and burial. We focus here on exploring physical processes at the shelf edge and outer shelf, particularly instabilities and eddies in the Bering Slope Current that result in the advection of nutrient rich waters onto the shelf. While such processes have been observed to occur, their impact on the Bering Sea shelf ecosystem has yet to be described.\n\nWe will use altimeter data from remote sensing to describe mesoscale circulation variability and to identify episodic events of onshelf flow. Satellite tracked drifters will be released to monitor currents and the temporal evolution of ocean color along the slope. One sampling expedition per year for two years will provide detailed information on the dynamics of the Bering Slope Current/Aleutian North Slope Current (BSC/ANSC) system and on bio-optical relationships between phytoplankton biomass and ocean color. Finally, the stability of the BSC/ANSC system will be examined using an analytical, jet-turning-a-corner model. This research will provide collaborating researchers a regional\ncontext within which to interpret contemporaneous drifter, hydrographic, biological, and bio-optical data acquired from the shelf/slope region of the southeastern Bering Sea.\n\nThis project also includes;\n\nEdward Cokelet \nPacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, NOAA \n7600 Sand Point Way NE\nSeattle, WA 98115\ncokelet@pmel.noaa.gov\n\nTerry Whitledge \nUniversity of Alaska Fairbanks \n\nStephen Okkonen \nUniversity of Alaska Fairbanks\n\nAn NPMR project",

            "description": "Recent declines in some species of marine organisms in the Bering Sea have spurred an interest in evaluating causes and predicting long-term impacts of these changes.  Red-legged kittiwakes (Rissa brevirostris) and black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) are two species of top-level predators that have declined since the mid-1970s at colonies in the Pribilof Islands, site of the largest breeding concentrations of seabirds in the southeastern Bering Sea. In contrast, Kittiwake populations have increased over\nthe same period at Bogoslof Island, 300 km south of the Pribilofs. Ocean climate trends\nand changes in marine food webs have been listed as likely causes of changes in seabird populations, but relationships between environmental factors and seabird\npopulation fluctuations are difficult to study directly. Nevertheless, it is important to understand causal mechanisms. We propose to compare kittiwake population parameters at the Pribilofs and Bogoslof. The Pribilof Islands lie on the continental\nshelf and are surrounded by water less than 200 m deep, whereas the much deeper\nwater of the basin surround Bogoslof.  We plan to test the hypothesis that divergent trends in abundance of kittiwakes (Rissa spp.) at two locations in the southeastern Bering Sea are related to differences in community structure and food web production. Specifically we will evaluate whether two parameters of reproduction, productivity (e.g., chicks/pair) and chick growth rates, are higher at Bogoslof than in the Pribilofs. Furthermore, we will evaluate historic patterns of population change, timing of nesting events, and various reproduction parameters (e.g., clutch size, laying success, hatching success, fledging success, chick growth) to evaluate correlation with environmental factors. This proposal is part of a multidisciplinary project called \"Regime Forcing and Ecosystem Response ReFER.\" It compliments and will benefit from an ongoing\nseabird-monitoring program in the Pribilof Islands funded by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nAn NPMR project",

            "description": "Recent declines in some species of marine organisms in the Bering Sea have spurred an interest in evaluating causes and predicting long-term impacts of these changes.  Red-legged kittiwakes (Rissa brevirostris) and black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) are two species of top-level predators that have declined since the mid-1970s at colonies in the Pribilof Islands, site of the largest breeding concentrations of seabirds in the southeastern Bering Sea. In contrast, Kittiwake populations have increased over\nthe same period at Bogoslof Island, 300 km south of the Pribilofs. Ocean climate trends\nand changes in marine food webs have been listed as likely causes of changes in seabird populations, but relationships between environmental factors and seabird\npopulation fluctuations are difficult to study directly. Nevertheless, it is important to understand causal mechanisms. We propose to compare kittiwake population parameters at the Pribilofs and Bogoslof. The Pribilof Islands lie on the continental\nshelf and are surrounded by water less than 200 m deep, whereas the much deeper\nwater of the basin surround Bogoslof.  We plan to test the hypothesis that divergent trends in abundance of kittiwakes (Rissa spp.) at two locations in the southeastern Bering Sea are related to differences in community structure and food web production. Specifically we will evaluate whether two parameters of reproduction, productivity (e.g., chicks/pair) and chick growth rates, are higher at Bogoslof than in the Pribilofs. Furthermore, we will evaluate historic patterns of population change, timing of nesting events, and various reproduction parameters (e.g., clutch size, laying success, hatching success, fledging success, chick growth) to evaluate correlation with environmental factors. This proposal is part of a multidisciplinary project called \"Regime Forcing and Ecosystem Response ReFER.\" It compliments and will benefit from an ongoing\nseabird-monitoring program in the Pribilof Islands funded by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nAn NPMR project",

            "description": "This project will expand the scope of the Alaska Native Harbor Seal Commission's (ANHSC) present biological sampling efforts to include subsistence hunters in communities west of Prince William Sound. The Commission is a tribal consortium\nconcerned with self-management of the harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) as a subsistence resource. The ANHSC already conducts a biological sampling program in nine communities and participates in the harvest data assessment program with the\nAlaska Department of Fish and Game Subsistence Division. We plan to expand this effort to nine more communities in western Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. Local technicians are selected and trained by the Commission's staff to perform basic necropsies on seals taken by subsistence hunters. Samples from these seals are sent to the University of Alaska Museum (UAM) for distribution to ongoing investigations and for archiving in the permanent collections.  Tissue samples will be archived in the Alaska Frozen Tissue Collection (AFTC) which has become the primary regional archive for frozen zoological samples and a major contributor to environmental studies of the North Pacific and Arctic oceans. It is now the world's third largest frozen tissue collection for wild mammals (Hafner et al. 1997). The increasingly powerful tools of molecular biology and biochemistry and the need to monitor perturbation of the environment are accelerating both collection growth and usage. In addition to supporting expanded\nmonitoring and sampling by the ANHSC, this project supports additional student help at UAM to process the increased number of samples. This project will increase the scope of sampling from a protected and potentially threatened high-trophic-level subsistence resource, and increase the scope of Native involvement in the study and management of marine resources.

We worked closely with people leading the Canadian Northern Contaminants Program, learning from their experience.\nWe decided that the most effective way to make information available to Alaska Natives and to interested government and university researchers is an interactive computer database. Three years ago many villages could not effectively access the internet. We therefore designed the database to work on individual computers. And, to avoid requiring Native villages to purchase special software, we designed the database to run on its own compiled version of Microsoft Access and Visual Basic. The database contains information on existing measures of contaminants in species of fish and animals harvested by Alaska Natives, harvest and consumption data, nutrition data, descriptions of the role of harvest and Native food consumption in communities, and examples of community initiatives taken in response to concerns about environmental change. The reader can see an overview of the Contaminants and Native Foods Database on the web at: www.nativeknowledge.org.",

            "description": "\"It is clear that a complex suite of significant interrelated, atmospheric, oceanic, and terrestrial changes has occurred in the Arctic in recent decades.  This event is affecting every part of the arctic environment and is having repercussions on society. There is evidence that these changes are connected with the rising trend  in the Arctic Oscillation (AO), a mode of atmospheric variability that is potentially active over a broad range of time scales, including climatic time scales, and that involves changes in the strength of the atmospheric polar vortex. There is theoretical evidence that the positive trend observed in the AO index might be indicative of greenhouse warming. It is unclear what feedback processes on climate or ecosystems may be involved in the recent changes, or what the long-term impacts may be. However, observations suggest the impact at high latitudes is substantial and the impact at middle latitudes is significant. Because the observed changes have made it harder for those who live in the North to predict what the future may bring, we have given the name Unaami (the yup'ik word for \"tomorrow\") to the complex of intertwined, pan-arctic changes.\"",

            "description": "Eleven cold-air outbreaks from the Arctic sea ice to the open water of the\n     Fram Strait and the Norwegian Sea have been monitored by aircraft during\n     the field campaigns ARKTIS 1991 and ARKTIS 1993.\n\n       Budgets of mass, water vapor, water, and heat in the atmospheric\n     boundary layer are computed for boxes that are located at different distances\n     from the ice edge ranging from the marginal ice zone to several hundred\n     kilometers downstream.\n\n       Averaged over all cold-air outbreaks, the large-scale flow is divergent near\n     the ice edge and convergent at larger distances from the ice edge. Regardless\n     of divergence, the large-scale flow exports everywhere water vapor, water,\n     and heat from an atmospheric box within the boundary layer. In the case of\n     the water vapor budget this export and the loss by condensation in clouds are\n     compensated by evaporation from the sea surface. Both the condensation in\n     clouds and surface evaporation increase in downstream direction, as does\n     their ratio from about 0.4 near the ice edge to about 0.8 at distances greater\n     than 300 km.\n\n       In the water budget, the source by condensation in clouds is compensated\n     by two sinks: large-scale flow export and precipitation. Precipitation\n     increases absolutely from about 1\uff964 mm day1 in downstream direction but\n     the ratio of precipitation versus condensation remains approximately constant\n     at a value of 0.75.\n\n       In contrast to the water vapor and water budgets with only one source, the\n     heat budget has several sources, namely, surface heat flux, entrainment heat\n     flux, condensation in clouds, and possibly radiation, which compensate for the\n     heat export by the large-scale flow. The relative importance of these sources\n     changes with distance from the ice edge. Near the ice edge, the surface heat\n     flux at the first place and the entrainment flux at the second place are the\n     relevant sources, while farther downstream in the region of deep\n     convection\uff97latent heat release by condensation is the dominating heat\n     source. Here, the surface heat flux is of secondary importance and the\n     entrainment flux plays a minor role.\n\n       Since a systematic transition from roll-like to cellular-like convection\n     patterns is present in Arctic cold-air outbreaks, the differences in the budgets\n     with respect to distance from the ice edge apply as well to the regions of rolls\n     and cells, respectively. It is hypothesized that mesoscale cellular convection\n     with cloud depths of more than 1 km does not occur unless the Bowen ratio\n     is less than about 0.6.",

THE DATA WAS RECORDED TO TWO-WAY TRAVEL-TIMES OF 15 TO 23 SECONDS, WITH 50 TO 75 METER SHOT SPACING. \n\nTWO NORTH-SOUTH TRANSECTS WERE PROFILED. THE EASTERN TRANSECT EXTENDED  FROM 58(50'N, 169(32'W, WELL WITHIN THE CONTINENTAL SHELF OF THE  BERING SEA, NORTH OF THE PRIBILOF ISLANDS, TO JUST SOUTH OF THE SHELF  EDGE NORTH OF BARROW, ALASKA, AT 71(49'N, 154(33'W. ICE PREVENTED CONTINUATION OF THE LINE BEYOND THE SHELF EDGE. THE\nWESTERN TRANSECT  EXTENDED FROM THE CENTRAL CHUKCHI SEA, WELL WITHIN THE SHELF AT  71(23'N, 163(00'W, INTO THE ALEUTIAN BASIN AT 58(00'N, 178(30'W, NEAR  NAVARINSKY CANYON. AN ADDITIONAL SHORT LINE CROSSING OVER THE BERINGIAN MARGIN A SECOND TIME WAS RECORDED NEAR ZEMCHUG CANYON EAST  OF THE WESTERN TRANSECT. \n\nTHE PROFILES CROSS IMPORTANT STRIKE-SLIP FAULTS, POSSIBLE TERRANE  BOUNDARIES, TWO CONTINENTAL MARGINS, AND SEVERAL CRETACEOUS /TERTIARY  SEDIMENTARY BASINS (NORTON, HOPE, CHUKCHI, AND NAVARIN BASINS).  TOGETHER WITH THE PRECEDING CRUISE EW94-09, THE PROFILES PROVIDE A CONTINUOUS TRANSECT ACROSS THE NORTH AMERICAN CONTINENT, FROM THE  PACIFIC TO THE ARCTIC OCEAN (SEE FIGURES 7 THROUGH 9 FOR DATA EXAMPLES).\n\nMOST OF THE MULTI-CHANNEL SEISMIC (MCS) DATA IS OF HIGH QUALITY,  BUT BAD WEATHER, STRONG CURRENTS, AND RECORDING PROBLEMS SOMETIMES  PRESENTED DIFFICULTIES DURING DATA ACQUISITION. GRAVITY, MAGNETIC,  AND SONOBUOY DATA WERE ALSO RECORDED ALONG THE PROFILES. WIDE-ANGLE RECORDING WAS DONE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SEISMIC PROFILING, AT RECORDING SITES LOCATED ALONG THE\n CENTRAL WEST COAST OF ALASKA AND THE CHUKCHI PENINSULA, AS WELL AS ON ISLANDS IN THE BERING STRAIT AND BERING SEA.",

This model contains atmospheric, oceanic, comprehensive\n     sea-ice (dynamic/thermodynamic plus leads), and biospheric submodels. The\n     model control run (over 100 years long) employed flux corrections and\n     displayed only a small amount of cooling, mainly at high latitudes. The\n     transient experiment (1% increase in CO2 compounding per annum) gave a\n     2\u00b0C warming at time of CO2 doubling. The model displayed a \uff93cold start\uff94\n     effect with a (maximum) value estimated at 0.3\u00b0C. The warming in the\n     transient run had an asymmetrical response as seen in other coupled models,\n     with the Northern Hemisphere (NH) warming more than the Southern\n     Hemisphere (SH). However, the land surface response in this model is\n     different from some other transient experiments in that there is not a\n     pronounced drying of the midlatitudes in the NH in summer.\n\n       In the control run the ice model gave realistic ice distributions at both poles,\n     with the NH ice in particular displaying considerable interdecadal variability.\n     In the transient run the ice amount decreased more in the NH than the SH\n     (corresponding with a greater NH warming). The NH ice extent and volume\n     in summer was considerably reduced in depth and extent compared to the\n     control. However, the model ice dynamics and thermodynamics allowed for a\n     successful regrowth of the ice during the winter season to give a coverage\n     comparable to that of the control run, although thinner.\n\n       During the transient run there is a freshening of the surface salinity in the\n     oceans at high latitudes. In the SH this is caused mainly by increases in\n     precipitation over evaporation. The same is true for the NH, but it is found\n     that there is a similar magnitude contribution to the polar freshening from ice\n     melt and land runoff changes. The freshening in the North Atlantic reduces the\n     strength of the meridional overturning by 35% at time of doubling of CO2.\n     Other changes in the global climate at the end of the transient run relative to\n     the control run are also investigated.",

            "description": "Bristol Bay is considered a nursery area for Pacific halibut and was closed to\n     commercial halibut fishing from 1967 to 1989. In the summer of 1987 the\n     International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) conducted a survey in\n     Bristol Bay to assess the commercial stock size of halibut and the incidence of\n     sublegal fish. Three vessels fished the coastal area from Cape Newenham to\n     Cape Seniavin. The catch per unit effort was 6 pounds, well below the catch\n     per unit effort observed in other areas of the Bering Sea. The catch of\n     sublegal halibut was low; less than 0.5 halibut per unit effort. The survey\n     results suggested that a limited commercial fishery in Bristol Bay would not\n     have an adverse impact on juvenile stocks. The IPHC extended the regulatory\n     Area 4E boundary to allow commercial fishing in Bristol Bay in 1990. Fishing\n     success has been poor compared to other areas and the number of vessels\n     reporting landings in the fishery decreased from 97 in 1990 to 19 in 1992.\n     Annual Bristol Bay catches have ranged from 14,000 to 26,000 pounds.",

            "description": "Surface ozone (O3) and its precursors in rural and urban areas of Hong\n     Kong are analyzed through the seasonal, temporal, and spatial variation\n     patterns. The seasonal O3 shows a unique pattern with a major peak in\n     autumn and a trough in summer. The spring and winter seasons are the\n     transition periods with a relatively small peak in spring. The seasonal\n     alternation of the prevailing oceanic and continental air masses, plus the\n     climate system associated with the Asian monsoon system, are the governing\n     factors for the temporal O3 pattern in Hong Kong. The O3 imported by these\n     air masses is found to be the dominating factor for the fluctuation of ambient\n     O3 in Hong Kong. The aged air masses associated with the continental\n     outflow from China carry with them anthropogenic air pollutants emitted from\n     the blooming industrial and urban neighborhoods north of Hong Kong in\n     Guangdong Province, China. Under favorable meteorological conditions for\n     photochemical O3 formation in southeast China, the O3 level reaches a\n     maximum in autumn. The absence of a local urban or a summer O3 peak\n     suggests that the local O3 formation is not the dominant source of O3 in\n     summer. The absence of an elevated ground-level O3 peak in the spring\n     season is an indication that the stratospheric intrusion process of O3 is not a\n     significant source of surface O3 in Hong Kong. The authors\uff92 analysis also\n     shows that the emission of O3 precursors from motor vehicles and the\n     complex topography within the territories has a local effect on the spatial O3\n     distribution and diurnal O3 pattern in Hong Kong.",

The\n     authors applied a forward stepwise program to derive linear multiple\n     regression equations that explained 81% of the variance of H by means of\n     only 3.5 variables, averaged over all months and grid points. The stability of\n     these equations held up well on 6 yr of independent data in terms of explained\n     variance, root-mean-square error, and the spatial anomaly correlation\n     coefficient. Therefore, it seems feasible to reconstruct maps of H for the first\n     half of the twentieth century as a function of data on P and T only.",

This lack of knowledge is of particular concern given the potential for degradation of habitats resulting from increased offshore and Prince William Sound shipping activities. Low-altitude aerial shoreline surveys at high tide every two to three days across the Delta, are being used to estimate phenology, relative abundance and distribution of shorebirds in spring.",

The purpose is to detect population trends over time for these species. National Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) protocol point count methods are used on all three districts of the Chugach National Forest to conduct annual neotropical migratory bird counts on an annual basis. In the Cordova Ranger District, permanent monitoring stations have been established on four point count transects and 2 BBS routes. Surveys have been conducted in these areas between 1992-1994. The Glacier District operates spring and fall banding and a MAPS (Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survival) station in Portage Valley. Seward Ranger District ran USFWS BBS route. Data is entered into a DBASE format and submitted to the Neotropical Monitoring Data Center in Redwood Science Laboratory, Arcata , California as part of and agreement with Region Ten USFS. These surveys will be conducted indefinitely as part of USFS contribution to the National Database. Contacts for individual districts are Steve Babler Cordova District, Cliff Fox, Glacier District, Bill Shuster, Seward District.",

These new atlases are\n     compared with previously published 5\u00b0 \uffd7 5\u00b0 coarse resolution maps of 1 for\n     the Northern Hemisphere and the South Atlantic and with a 1\u00b0 \uffd7 1\u00b0\n     fine-resolution map of c1 for the tropical Pacific. It is concluded that the\n     methods used in these earlier estimates yield values that are biased\n     systematically low by 5%\uff9615% owing to seemingly minor computational\n     errors. Geographical variations in the new high-resolution maps of c1 and 1\n     are discussed in terms of a WKB approximation that elucidates the effects of\n     earth rotation, stratification, and water depth on these quantities. It is shown\n     that the effects of temporal variations of the stratification can be neglected in\n     the estimation of c1 and 1 at any particular location in the World Ocean.\n     This is rationalized from consideration of the WKB approximation.",

Rotated principal components (time series) derived\n     from this analysis are related to anomalies of seasonal-mean global sea\n     surface temperature, and monthly mean Northern Hemisphere 500-hPa\n     geopotential height and sea level pressure (SLP).\n\n       Wintertime seasonal-mean precipitation in California is captured by two\n     RPCs. The first RPC documents coherent precipitation anomalies centered in\n     northern California, Oregon, southern Idaho, and eastern Washington, and\n     explains the largest portion of area-averaged variance of any of the patterns in\n     the decomposition. A second RPC captures coherent precipitation variability\n     in the south coast and southeast desert regions of California, southern\n     Nevada, southern Utah, and northern Arizona. Fluctuations in the first RPC\n     correlate poorly with Pacific Ocean SST anomalies. However, wet winters in\n     the region of the second RPC correlate modestly with simultaneous cool\n     western subtropical Pacific Ocean SST anomalies and weakly with warm\n     SST anomalies over a broad region of the central and eastern tropical Pacific.\n     The spatial scale of the tropical SST correlation and the prominent\n     multidecadal timescale signal of the RPC are consistent with ENSO\n     fluctuations on this timescale influencing southern California precipitation.\n\n       Consistent with the results of earlier studies, significant correlation are\n     found between California wintertime monthly mean precipitation variability\n     and regional 500-hPa geopotential height and SLP anomalies. Linear\n     regression analysis is used to construct estimates of the total 500-hPa\n     geopotential height and SLP fields (Climatology plus anomaly) that are\n     representative of the extreme wet and dry California winter months; these are\n     then compared with the observed conditions in the individual extreme months.\n     Several different flow patterns appear capable of producing anomalously\n     large monthly precipitation totals in California.",

            "description": "Data Type: Boundaries; This is a composite land ownership/land status layer based primarily on the Chugach National Forest (CNF) land status GIS database and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land records (as processed into a GIS format by Alaska Department of Natural Resources (DNR)). The CNF database includes owner, status and parcel boundaries for all lands within the CNF boundary. These parcel boundaries are based on legal descriptions, plats, and other sources drafted onto 1:31,680 scale base maps. Pacific GIS used land status records from Alaska DNR for areas outside the CNF boundary (primarily the Copper River basin). The DNR dataset is coarser in resolution (i.e., to the nearest section) than the datasets available through the Chugach NF. Alaska DNR bases their understanding of land status on a statewide digital (but non- geographic) database maintained by the BLM. In general, these records are thematically accurate but do not carry specific parcel boundaries. At a regional level of analysis, the coarse nature of this data is acceptable, but the user should recognize this limitations of this source data. Land ownership and status is dynamic, particularly in Alaska, where land is still being transferred from federal to state and Native corporation ownership, and from state to private ownership under the Alaska Statehood Act, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, and various state homestead and land disposal programs. Due to the many and frequent changes in land ownership and status, Pacific GIS recommends obtaining updated information from the source agencies.",

Pacific GIS built this layer by merging data from the Alaska Department of Natural Resources (DNR), the Chugach National Forest, and the National Park Service. Land protection is a relative, rather than absolute concept; uses that would be allowed under one level of protective status (such as logging in a National Forest) would be prohibited in other types of designation (such as wilderness areas within a National Park). The protected areas layer includes\nsufficient information on specific designations within larger jurisdictions to allow relative ratings of protection to be developed.

Pacific GIS derived this shaded relief layer from elevation data which is based on digital elevation model (DEM) data at 1:250,000 scale acquired from the USGS EROS Alaska Field Office. The shading is a mathematically calculated value to provide the illusion of a terrain surface being illuminated by an implied light source. It is useful as a back- drop for other data because it gives an intuitive view of the landscape.",

            "description": "The characteristics of extratropical low-frequency variability are examined\n     using a comprehensive atmospheric general circulation model. A large\n     experiment consisting of 13 45-yr-long integrations forced by prescribed sea\n     surface temperature (SST) variations is analyzed. The predictability of\n     timescales of seasonal to decadal averages is evaluated. The variability of a\n     climate mean contains not only climate signal arising from external boundary\n     forcing but also climate noise due to the internal dynamics of the climate\n     system, resulting in various levels of predictability that are dependent on the\n     forcing boundary conditions and averaging timescales. The focus of this study\n     deviates from the classic predictability study of Lorenz, which is essentially\n     initial condition sensitive. This study can be considered to be a model\n     counterpart of Madden\uff92s \uff93potential\uff94 predictability study.\n\n       The tropical SST anomalies impact more on the predictability over the\n     Pacific/North America sector than the Atlantic/Eurasia sector. In the former\n     sector, more significant and positive impacts are found during El Ni\ufff1o and La\n     Ni\ufff1a phases of the ENSO cycle than during the ENSO inactive period of\n     time. Furthermore, the predictability is significantly higher during El Ni\ufff1o than\n     La Ni\ufff1a phases of the ENSO cycle. The predictability of seasonal means\n     exhibits large seasonality for both warm and cold phases of the ENSO cycle.\n     During the warm phases, a high level of predictability is observed from\n     December to April. During the cool phases, the predictability rapidly drops to\n     below normal from November to March. The spring barrier in the\n     atmospheric predictability is therefore a distinct phenomenon for the cold\n     phase, not the warm phase, of the ENSO cycle. The cause of the barrier can\n     be traced to the smaller climate signal and larger climate noise generated\n     during cold events, which in turn can be traced back to the rapidly weakening\n     negative SST anomalies in the tropical Pacific east of the date line.\n\n       Due to the fact that the signal to noise ratio of this model climate system is\n     very small, an upper bound in atmospheric predictability is present, even\n     when a perfect model atmosphere is considered and large ensemble mean\n     predictions are exploited. The outstanding issues of the dynamical short-term\n     climate prediction employing an atmospheric general circulation model are\n     examined, the current model deficiencies identified, and continuing efforts in\n     model development addressed.",

            "description": "Numerical simulations of terrain-induced turbulence associated with airflow\n     over Lantau Island of Hong Kong are presented. Lantau is a relatively small\n     island with three narrow peaks rising to between 700 and 950 m above mean\n     sea level. This research was undertaken as part of a project to better\n     understand and predict the nature of turbulence and shear at the new airport\n     site on the island of Chek Lap Kok, which is located to the lee of Lantau.\n     Intensive ground and aerial observations were taken from May through June\n     1994, during the Lantau Experiment (LANTEX). This paper focuses on flow\n     associated with the passage of Tropical Storm Russ on 7 June 1994, during\n     which severe turbulence was observed.\n\n       The nature of the environmental and topographic forcing on 7 June 1994\n     resulted in the turbulence and shear being dominated by the combination of\n     topographic effects and surface friction. High-resolution numerical\n     simulations, initialized using local sounding data, were performed using the\n     Clark model. The simulation results indicate that gravity-wave dynamics\n     played a very minor role in the flow distortion and generation of turbulence.\n     As a result of this flow regime, relatively high vertical and horizontal resolution\n     was required to simulate the mechanically generated turbulence associated\n     with Tropical Storm Russ.\n\n       Results are presented using a vertical resolution of 10 m near the surface\n     and with horizontal resolutions of both 125 and 62.5 m over local, nested\n     domains of about 13\uff9624 km on a side. The 125-m model resolution\n     simulated highly distorted flow in the lee of Lantau, with streaks emanating\n     downstream from regions of sharp orographic gradients. At this resolution the\n     streaks were nearly steady in time. At the higher horizontal resolution of 62.5\n     m the streaks became unstable, resulting in eddies advecting downstream\n     within a distorted streaky mean flow similar to the 125-m resolution\n     simulation. The temporally averaged fields changed little with the increase in\n     resolution; however, there was a three- to fourfold increase in the temporal\n     variability of the flow, as indicated by the standard deviation of the wind from\n     a 10-min temporal average. Overall, the higher resolution simulations\n     compared quite well with the observations, whereas the lower resolution\n     cases did not. The high-resolution experiments also showed a much broader\n     horizontal and vertical extent for the transient eddies. The depth of orographic\n     influence increased from about 200 m to over 600 m with the increase in\n     resolution. A physical explanation, using simple linear arguments based on the\n     blocking effects of the eddies, is presented. The nature of the flow separation\n     is analyzed using Bernoulli\uff92s energy form to display the geometry of the\n     separation bubbles. The height of the 80 m2 s2 energy surface shows\n     eddies forming in regions of large orographic gradients and advecting\n     downstream.\n\n       Tests using both buoyancy excitation and stochastic backscatter to\n     parameterize the underresolved dynamics at the 125-m resolution are\n     presented, as well as one experiment testing the influence of static stability\n     suppressing turbulence development. All these tests showed no significant\n     effect. Implications of these results to the parameterization of mechanically\n     induced turbulence in complex terrain are discussed.",

This classification system was developed prior to the spill by Minerals Management Services and NOAA. The sensitivity classification divides shorelines into 10 categories 1 being least sensitive to 10 the most sensitive. This depiction has been mapped using ARC/INFO to classify shoreline for each of the three spill affected areas, Prince William Sound (PWS), Cook Inlet (CIK) and Kodiak Island region (KAP). The intended use of this data was for analysis purposes with other resource layers to attempt to model the potential effects of oiling.",

            "description": "Anomalous wave source regions are identified during the life cycles of\n     persistent flow anomalies occurring over the North Pacific and North\n     Atlantic Oceans during boreal winter. These cases project strongly upon the\n     Pacific\uff96North American and Eastern Atlantic teleconnection patterns,\n     respectively, and represent two of the primary modes of intraseasonal low\n     frequency variability in the Northern Hemisphere wintertime circulation. In\n     the upper troposphere, these cases are manifested by wave trains of\n     large-scale and large amplitude flow anomalies extending downstream from\n     key regions near the Aleutian Islands and south of Iceland, respectively. The\n     occurrence of persistent flow anomalies is closely linked to persistent\n     extremes in surface weather and to variations in the skill of extended-range\n     weather forecasts. Black and Dole performed a detailed diagnostic analysis\n     of the onset of persistent cyclonic flow anomalies over the North Pacific. A\n     key result of their study was that wave activity flux diagnoses correctly\n     identified the location of anomalous wave source regions.\n\n       Black and Dole\uff92s study is extended by diagnosing three-dimensional\n     fluxes of wave activity during the onset, maintenance, and decay of cyclonic\n     and anticyclonic persistent flow anomalies over the North Atlantic and North\n     Pacific regions. The flux characterizes large-scale wave propagation, and the\n     flux divergence is used to deduce the location of regional sources and sinks\n     of anomalous wave activity. In all cases there is a marked upward and\n     downstream flux of wave activity emanating from the lower troposphere near\n     the key region. The results are consistent with a local wave source and\n     Rossby-like wave propagation away from the source. There is little evidence\n     that anomalous remote processes directly force persistent flow anomaly life\n     cycles. The diagnostic analyses indicate that the primary anomalous wave\n     sources for both cyclonic and anticyclonic persistent flow anomalies are local\n     to the region of their occurrence. It remains possible, however, that\n     anomalous remote forcing plays an indirect or catalytic role in some cases.",

            "description": "The island of St. Vincent and the other Windward Islands in the\n     southeastern Caribbean were chosen as a field site for the study of weak\n     mountain wakes. By the authors\uff92 definition, a \uff93weak wake\uff94 forms when the\n     potential vorticity generated by a mountain is not strong enough to advect\n     itself into eddies; rather, it is simply advocated downstream by the ambient\n     flow. GOES-8 and Landsat sunlit images unambiguously revealed that the\n     mountainous Windward Islands have remarkably long straight wakes. The\n     length of St. Vincent\uff92s wake exceeds 300 km although its width is only 20\n     km. Near the islands, the wake structures reflect the details of the island\n     topography. These wakes do not exhibit any obvious diurnal effect.\n\n       Boat surveys in the lee of St. Vincent confirmed the existence of features\n     seen in the images: the sharp wake boundary, the small valley-induced jet\n     embedded in the near wake, and the absence of any reverse flow. Aircraft\n     surveys gave evidence of descent over the island and showed that the wake\n     air is relatively warm and dry. The length of the wake (L) agrees with the\n     formula L = H/2CD (where H is the wake depth and CD is the surface drag\n     coefficient), implying that the reacceleration of the wake air is caused by the\n     ambient streamwise pressure gradient rather than by lateral entrainment of\n     momentum or geostrophic adjustment.\n\n       Two numerical models were used to simulate St. Vincent\uff92s wake, a\n     single-layer hydrostatic model and a 3D nonhydrostatic model. Both models\n     indicated that air descent, acceleration, wave breaking, and weak potential\n     vorticity generation occur over the island, causing a long straight wake.",

The fall data represented a summary of beached oil concentrations following the completion of all major spill treatment in 1989. Survey dates were from  September 11, 1989 through November 3, 1989. Surveys were conducted by on-site transects, primarily at low tide. ADEC's goal was to map and monitor all known locations of beached oil. Oiling data were verified with ADEC to assure the accuracy of Natural Resources Damage Assessment files. Shorelines were walked by teams of two or three people. Inaccessible areas were surveyed by skiff; no oiling was classified from the air. Each team used a computer generated map from 1:63,630 source material, showing a beach segment on a single page, typically enlarged to a scale of 1:10,000. During this survey information was also recorded on oil penetration, oil thickness, shoreline type, sediment type, location of photographs and sediment samples, quality of oil, location of oiling within the inter-tidal area, and focus damage. The intended purpose of this database is to provide a resource for use in the oil spill damage identification, oil spill response, and future habitat restoration activities.",

Data was collected under the supervision of the Alaska Department of Environment Conservation (ADEC) with the goal to map and monitor all know locations of beached oil. The ADEC cumulative shoreline oiling through August 1989 provided NRDA with the most comprehensive shoreline oiling data. These observations were based on fixed-wing, helicopter, and on-site records made by a limited number of trained ADEC personnel and backed by a formal ADEC documentation process. The information represents the cumulative oil impact from March 28, 1989 to the end of the month which was reported. The intended use of the dataset is for spill damage identification, oil spill response, habitat restoration activities.",

            "description": "Steady drift of an ice cover produces a vertically sheared current in the\n     upper ocean of the Arctic. Under the ice cover, mesoscale shallow brine and\n     freshening sources generate submerged anticyclones and cyclones,\n     respectively. A submerged eddy extending deep into the water column\n     experiences differential advections by the vertically sheared current.\n     Interaction between subsurface eddies and the sheared current is examined\n     using a three-dimensional numerical model in a coordinate system moving\n     with the ice. The initial salinity field is in geostrophic balance with the sheared\n     current, and a pulse of brine or freshening forcing produces an anticyclone or\n     a cyclone. In a coordinate system moving with the ice, eddies are in a\n     vertically sheared backward ambient current. To an observer looking into\n     the direction of the backward ambient current, eddies move with the current\n     and deflect to the right (left) for counterclockwise (clockwise) rotating\n     eddies in both hemispheres. The lower half of the eddy always moves faster.\n     The lateral movement can be explained by the Kutta\uff96Zhukhovski lift\n     theorem. Differential advection produces eddy tilting and entails the\n     development of a narrow jet following the moving eddy. The jet reduces\n     eddy straining and tilting, and eddies disperse in cases of sizeable tilts.\n     Driven by a vertically sheared current, cyclones are short-lived compared\n     with anticyclones because the lateral movement of a cyclone exposes the\n     lower part of the eddy into waters of weaker stratification. The results help\n     explain the predominance of anticyclonic eddies under the Arctic ice.",

Thirteen formal presentations on marine reserves\n     and fishery refugia catalyzed a lengthy and far-ranging discussion of the\n     potential of refugia as fishery management tools, the strengths and limitations\n     of refugia-based management, existing evidence of refugia efficacy, the need\n     for further testing, and design considerations for fishery refugia. The\n     presentations represented a wide variety of ecological and socioeconomic\n     systems, ranging from tropical coral reef in Western Australia, Florida,\n     Bermuda, and the Cayman Islands, through temperate reef systems in\n     California, New Zealand, and South Australia, to arctic systems in the Bering\n     Sea; crustacean and molluscan fisheries were examined as well as those for\n     temperate and tropical reef finfishes.",

            "description": "The Climate System Model (CSM) consists of atmosphere, ocean, land,\n     and sea-ice components linked by a flux coupler, which computes fluxes of\n     energy and momentum between components. The sea-ice component\n     consists of a thermodynamic formulation for ice, snow, and leads within the\n     ice pack, and ice dynamics using the cavitating-fluid ice rheology, which\n     allows for the compressive strength of ice but ignores shear viscosity.\n\n       The results of a 300-yr climate simulation are presented, with the focus on\n     sea ice and the atmospheric forcing over sea ice in the polar regions. The\n     atmospheric model results are compared to analyses from the European\n     Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and other observational\n     sources. The sea-ice concentrations and velocities are compared to satellite\n     observational data.\n\n       The atmospheric sea level pressure (SLP) in CSM exhibits a high in the\n     central Arctic displaced poleward from the observed Beaufort high. The\n     Southern Hemisphere SLP over sea ice is generally 5 mb lower than\n     observed. Air temperatures over sea ice in both hemispheres exhibit cold\n     biases of 2\uff964 K. The precipitation-minus-evaporation fields in both\n     hemispheres are greatly improved over those from earlier versions of the\n     atmospheric GCM.\n\n       The simulated ice-covered area is close to observations in the Southern\n     Hemisphere but too large in the Northern Hemisphere. The ice concentration\n     fields show that the ice cover is too extensive in the North Pacific and\n     Subarctic North Atlantic Oceans. The interannual variability of the ice area is\n     similar to observations in both hemispheres. The ice thickness pattern in the\n     Antarctic is realistic but generally too thin away from the continent. The\n     maximum thickness in the Arctic occurs against the Bering Strait, not against\n     the Canadian Archipelago as observed. The ice velocities are stronger than\n     observed in both hemispheres, with a consistently greater turning angle (to\n     the left) in the Southern Hemisphere. They produce a northward ice\n     transport in the Southern Hemisphere that is 3\uff964 times the satellite-derived\n     value. Sensitivity tests with the sea-ice component show that both the pattern\n     of wind forcing in CSM and the air-ice drag parameter used contribute to\n     the biases in thickness, drift speeds, and transport. Plans for further\n     development of the ice model to incorporate a viscous-plastic ice rheology\n     are presented.\n\n       In spite of the biases of the sea-ice simulation, the 300-yr climate\n     simulation exhibits only a small degree of drift in the surface climate without\n     the use of flux adjustment. This suggests a robust stability in the simulated\n     climate in the presence of significant variability.",

Pacific GIS filled gaps in the Channel Type Database with stream information from the DNR Oil Spill Database. Stream data for areas outside Prince William Sound was drawn largely from the Alaska DNR ALARM Database. Data obtained from the USGS DLG data is very small scale (1:2,000,000 scale) and is suitable only for an overview of streams within the region. All stream data except that obtained from the Chugach NF Channel Type database include information on presence of anadromous fish, although this information is variable in age and not documented as to source.

This layer covers the Prince William Sound - Copper River ecosystem and includes information on lakes, wide river channels, marine areas, and glaciers. The most detailed stream and lake coverages for Prince William Sound are taken largely from the Chugach National Forest's Channel Type Database (for line features) and the Timber Type Database (for polygonal features).  Pacific GIS filled gaps in these datasets with stream and lake information from the Alaska Department of Natural Resources (DNR) Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Database. Pacific GIS drew stream data for areas outside of Prince William Sound largely from Alaska DNR's Alaska Land and Resource Mapping  (ALARM) database. This dataset is considerably coarser than the hydrography information for Prince William Sound. All stream data, except those obtained from the Chugach National Forest Channel Type Database, include information on presence of anadromous fish, although this information is variable in age and not documented as to source. Pacific GIS merged these datasets used for this quad-by-quad layer to develop a composite surface hydrography layer for the Prince William Sound - Copper River basin ecosystem (hydro_pl in the ecosystem directory). A related data layer, river250 contains stream data for the greater PWS - Copper River ecosystem.",

The\n     model is used to address Arctic numerical modeling with and without climate\n     restoring. The model without climate restoring reproduces basic observed\n     features of the Arctic ice\uff96ocean circulation. The simulated oceanic\n     processes adjust to the surface and lateral fluxes and transport heat and\n     mass in a way that achieves a rough salt and heat balance in the Arctic in the\n     integration period of seven decades. The main deficiency of the model is its\n     prediction of unrealistically high salinity in the central Arctic, which tends to\n     weaken the ocean currents.\n\n       The introduction of corrective salinity and temperature restoring terms has\n     a significant impact on prediction of the ice\uff96ocean circulation in the Arctic.\n     The impact results from a chain reaction. First, the restoring terms change\n     the salinity and thermal states in the oceanic mixed layer and below. The\n     altered density structure, in turn, influences the ocean circulation by altering\n     the ocean\uff92s dynamic and thermodynamic processes. The ocean circulation\n     then affects ice motion and ice thickness by altering the dynamics and\n     thermodynamics of the ice. Restoring only ocean salinity induces a heat\n     surplus or deficit, which causes the oceanic thermal state to drift away from\n     the Climatology. This is also the case with restoring both salinity and\n     temperature in the upper ocean. Only restoring salinity and temperature in\n     the deeper ocean is likely to avoid climate drift in the Arctic.\n\n       This paper points out the problems of using models without climate\n     restoring and the consequences of using models with climate restoring for\n     Arctic ice\uff96ocean modeling. It stresses the need to use a realistic\n     representation of surface fluxes in order to improve prognostic simulations. It\n     also stresses the importance of oceanic processes such as connective\n     overturning and vertical advection both in the Arctic and in the adjacent\n     oceans. If these processes are not reasonably represented, the models can\n     predict over warm intermediate layers in the Arctic and an excessive heat\n     influx at Fram Strait, causing the Arctic ice pack to possibly shrink gradually,\n     a scenario global climate models should avoid.",

Aerial surveys were flown in a Piper PA-18 aircraft in late November 1994 - January 1995. moose habitat was searched at 1.4-2.2 minutes per square mile. Sex and age ratio estimates were obtained from data collected prior to mid-December. Total numbers in most populations were estimated based on densities observed during aerial surveys, percentage of wintering habitat surveyed, and quality of survey conditions. When survey conditions were not complete, population estimates were based on historical trends. Purpose of this data is to monitor moose populations on the Chugach National Forest lands and to use moose as an indicator species of diversity and habitat health.",

            "description": "Puget Sound is modeled as a branched system of two-layered advective reaches separated by mixing zones. Fresh water and salt provide\nconvenient tracers to calculate the annual mean layer transports. The technique utilizes historical records (1951-1956) of runoff and salinity\nwhich are analyzed with the aid of modern (principally 1970's) current meter records to provide the appropriate mass conserving\nlandward- and seaward-flowing layer salinities for each reach. This is the first time that the long-term transports have been estimated\nsimultaneously for the entire Strait of Juan de Fuca/Puget Sound system. With few exceptions the inferred transports agree well with\nestimates derived from scattered, shorter duration current observations. Uncertainties in the transports are estimated from uncertainties in\nthe runoff, velocity profiles and salinities. The results provide the basis for future computations of refluxing and the steady state tracer\nconcentrations and ages in the Sound.",

Tsunami vertical runup measurements varied between 15 and 30 m\nover a 20-km portion of the southern part of Okushiri Island with several 10-m values on the northern portion of the Island. Along the west coast of Hokkaido, no\nsurvey values exceeded 10 m, but damage was extensive at several coastal towns. Given the sudden onset of the tsunami and its high energy, it is amazing that more\npeople were not killed. We also observed that the seawall at Aonae was effective in reducing runup amplitudes.",

            "description": "A dynamic sea ice model based on granular material rheology is\n     presented. The sea ice model is coupled to both a mixed layer ocean model\n     and a one-layer thermodynamic atmospheric model, which allows for an ice\n     albedo feedback. Land is represented by a 6-m thick layer with a constant\n     base temperature. A 10-year integration including both thermodynamic and\n     dynamic effects and incorporating prescribed climatological wind stress and\n     ocean current data was performed in order for the model to reach a stable\n     periodic seasonal cycle. The commonly observed lead complexes, along\n     which sliding and opening of adjacent ice floes occur in the Arctic sea ice\n     cover, are well reproduced in this simulation. In particular, shear lines\n     extending from the western Canadian Archipelago toward the central Arctic,\n     often observed in winter satellite images, are present. The ice edge is well\n     positioned both in winter and summer using this thermodynamically coupled\n     ocean\uff96ice\uff96atmosphere model. The results also yield a sea ice circulation and\n     thickness distribution over the Arctic, which are in good agreement with\n     observations. The model also produces an increase in ice formation\n     associated with the dilatation of the ice medium along sliding lines. In this\n     model, incident energy absorbed by the ocean melts ice laterally and warms\n     the mixed layer, causing a smaller ice retreat in the summer. This cures a\n     problem common to many existing thermodynamic\uff96dynamic sea ice models",

Data will be automated in GIS format for use in the Chugach Forest Plan revision process. This data set's intended use is for baseline data support for project oriented projects being conducted within the forest on the Kenai Peninsula. The Copper River Delta integrated inventory includes landform, soils, and vegetation communities is almost complete. It will be entered into the Chugach GIS system in ARC/INFO format. A general lands system inventory scheduled for completion in 1995 for the entire forest is presently being conducted and includes landforms and sub group soils mapping.",

The software, called the Graphical Resource Database (GRD), is part of Alyeska's commitment to the Prince William Sound Tanker Oil Discharge Prevention and Contingency Plan. The GRD consists of layers of coastal resource digital data records (such as seabird colony sites and sea otter concentration areas) that are linked to points, lines, or polygons depicting animal distributions on computer-generated maps. The expansion and update effort is coordinated by a committee consisting of representatives from federal and state natural resource trustee agencies, citizens oversight groups, Alyeska, and oil shipping companies. The data collection and checking process is conducted in accordance with written standard operating procedures. Data are gathered from the trustee agencies, compiled into Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, and verified using quality control/quality assurance procedures. The spreadsheets are then loaded into a commercially available mapping program, MapInfo , which serves as an intermediate graphical data management tool. The data are transferred from MapInfo to the GRD using FORTRAN programs. Data is available to federal and state agencies for oil spill planning and response.",

Temperatures are derived from a new\n     gridded 6-h, 2-m air temperature dataset called POLES. These gridded air\n     temperatures are estimated from optimal interpolation of temperature inputs\n     from drifting buoys, manned Soviet North Pole (NP) drifting ice stations,\n     coastal land weather stations, and ship reports. In processing the POLES\n     data, the winter and summer properties of the mean NP temperatures are\n     used to discard inaccurate or snow-covered buoys and to remove a summer\n     warm bias. Comparison of the POLES and specific NP temperatures shows\n     that the POLES temperature behaves well and gives better results than other\n     gridded temperature datasets. Maps of the mean seasonal temperatures give\n     realistic results consistent with other published estimates, and plots of the\n     summer advance and retreat of the 0\u00b0C isotherm show the expected\n     asymmetry between advance and retreat associated with the open water\n     formation adjacent to the coasts. Also, comparison of the regional POLES\n     observations of the annual onset of melt and freeze with published estimates\n     derived from visible and passive microwave satellite data gives realistic\n     results. However, problems with the dataset arise in the post-1991 period\n     from the termination of the NP stations and a reduction in the number of\n     Siberian and Alaskan weather stations. In spite of these problems, the paper\n     shows that the POLES dataset provides an improved air temperature field\n     for use in numerical sea ice models and for comparison with satellite\n     datasets.",

Gridded data is a summarization of raw NOS data information and includes the mean, maximum, and minimum depths recorded in each cell in a 15 second latitude by 15 second longitude grid.

The DNR bathymetric data is based primarily on National Ocean Service (NOS) data. NOS publishes digital bathymetric data in two forms: raw depths of all soundings from included bathymetric surveys; and \"gridded\" data. Gridded data is a summarization of raw NOS data information and includes the mean, maximum, and minimum depths recorded in each cell in a 15 second latitude by 15 second longitude grid. The Alaska DNR augmented the NOS gridded data with information from NOAA nautical charts and converted it to bathymetric contours (interval = 20 m) and polygons suitable for shading.

The shoreline data used to cover the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill (EVOS) region is currently shared and held in common by the involved State and Federal agencies. This transaction occurred early on after the spill so subsequent data related to the coastline would be consistently defined. The shoreline data covering PWS was cooperatively sourced from USFS, Chugach Forest Office. The coverage was digitized from the most currently available 1:63360 USGS map series, with the exception of USFS Big Islands Management Area (Green, Montague, Hawkins, Hinchinbrook, and associated satellite islands. The coastline for the Big Islands was derived from Chugach National Forest 1:31,680 timber type maps. These maps were created from 1:15,840 1974 USFS photography. Coastline was determined at mean high tideline. Green Island, Little Green Island and satellite islands were replaced using 1988 USGS 1:63,360 maps. CIK shoreline was purchased from ComRim Systems Inc. at the same scale using USGS basemaps. Information on thousands of small islands and rock outcrops was taken from the Exxon shoreline for PWS and CIK.",

            "description": "The surface temperature field in the Arctic winter is primarily controlled by\n     downward longwave radiation, which is determined by local atmospheric\n     temperature and humidity profiles and the presence of clouds. The authors\n     show that regional differences in the atmospheric thermal energy budget are\n     related to the tropospheric circulation in the Arctic. Data sources include\n     several gridded meteorological datasets and surface and rawinsonde\n     observational data. Four independent climatologies of mean January surface\n     temperature show consistent spatial patterns: coldest temperatures in the\n     western Arctic north of Canada and warmer regions in the Chukchi,\n     Greenland, and Barents Seas. Data from the five winters of 1986\uff9690\n     illustrate the coupling between the surface temperature, the downward\n     longwave radioactive fields, and the tropospheric temperature and humidity\n     fields, with monthly surface\uff96upper-air correlation on the order of 0.6.\n     Upper-level circulation patterns reveal features similar to the surface\n     temperature fields, notably a persistent low center located over northern\n     Canada; the cyclonic flow around the low is a tropospheric extension of the\n     polar vortex. Colder and drier conditions are maintained within the vortex\n     and communicated to the surface through radioactive processes. The polar\n     vortex also steers transient weather systems, the most important mechanism\n     for horizontal heat transport, into the eastern Arctic, which results in as much\n     as 25 W m2 more heat flux into the eastern Arctic than the western Arctic.\n     A reason for the colder temperatures in the western Arctic is that the polar\n     vortex tends to be situated downstream of the northern Rocky Mountains;\n     this preferred location is related to orographic forcing of planetary waves.\n     Monthly and interannual variability of winter temperatures is conditioned by\n     the interaction of the Arctic and midlatitude circulations through the strength\n     and position of the polar vortex.",

            "description": "Recent climate records from ice cores and deep-sea sediments suggest that\n        there has been considerable climate variability in the North Atlantic region\n        over the past 250,000 years. Much of this variability may be linked to changes\n        in thermohaline circulation in the North Atlantic ocean. Model studies have\n        demonstrated that changes in the flux of fresh water to the ocean, resulting\n        from changes in atmospheric transport or the waxing and waning of ice sheets,\n        can have a significant effect on the thermohaline circulation. The authors\n        present model simulations showing that increased flow of fresher North Pacific\n        water through the Bering Strait into the northern North Atlantic can also\n        effect the thermohaline circulation, by suppressing North Atlantic Deep Water\n        formation; however, decreased flow does not necessarily cause deep-water\n        formation to begin again. In the model, flow through the Bering Strait\n        depends on ecstatic sea level and the salinity difference between the North\n        Atlantic and North Pacific oceans. The authors suggest that a higher sea level\n        during the last interglacial period, leading to greater flow through the Bering\n        Strait, may have made the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation more\n        sensitive than it is at present to fluctuations in the hydrological cycle, which\n        may explain recent observations indicating that climate variability was greater\n        then than it is today.",

Intended use of information is to aid CRNA meet criteria to establish permanent rights for Ahtna shareholders to pursue subsistence activities in Wrangell St. Elias National Park and preserve and protect Ahtna subsistence use areas and resources from urban competition. This database is part of a cooperative agreement with NPS and BLM to develop information relevant to Customary and Traditional Use determinations, the establishment of Residential Zones for subsistence use in the park and to establish a roster of eligible subsistence users in the Park/Preserve under section 1344 of ANILCA. Copies of the final dataset will reside at BLM, Ahtna, Copper River Native Assoc., and NPS. Some layers of this dataset have been extracted as separate records in the metadata database as they represent data that was automated as a result of this dataset compilation and are new electronic products.

The monthly sea ice grids are available on request\nvia ftp (see access instructions below), and may eventually be distributed \non CD-ROM with other SSM/I products.  The monthly sea ice grids can be used \nas a mask to block out ice-covered areas for various applications.  To \naccommodate as many  potential applications as possible, the monthly averaged \nice extent was delineated using four concentration values (0%, 5%, 10%, and \n15%) for the minimum concentrations included in the averages.  The grids are \n8-bit raster images containing 448 lines of 304 pixels (304x by 448y) for the\nnorthern hemisphere and 332 lines of 316 pixels (316x by 332y) for the\nsouthern.  IDL procedures were used to calculate monthly averages from the\ndaily-averaged SSM/I grids.  The data were then put into Hierarchical Data\nFormat (HDF).  Utilities to read and manipulate HDF data are available via\nftp from the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA).  The\nNCSA ftp server address is ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu; help is available from\nhelphdf@ncsa.uiuc.edu.",

            "description": "Data Type: Vegetation/Land Cover/Soils;  This data layer is a composite of vegetation and land cover data encompassing all of Prince William Sound and the Copper River drainage and eastern portions of the Kenai Peninsula. Original data sources include the Chugach National Forest Timber Type database, Interim Land Cover Program and Copper River Land Cover images from USGS EROS Alaska Field Office, and the Alaska Land and Resource Mapping System (ALARM) from the Alaska Department of Natural Resources (DNR). All of the original datasets were generalized; merged, and classified according to the Alaska Vegetation Classification, resulting in a generalized layer that broadly characterizes vegetation patterns throughout the area. Characteristics of the original data bases are outlined below; the data sets used to create this composite vegetation layer are documented separately The Chugach NF Timber Type database is a timber oriented vegetation layer based on interpretation of aerial photography. It is the most detailed digital vegetation information available for substantial areas within the greater Prince William Sound ecosystem. The database contains detailed information about timbered areas including species composition, stand density, stocking levels, stand class size, and volume. Many of these timber-oriented descriptions can be useful as surrogates for important ecological variables such as structural information about a given stand. The database also contains less detailed information on non- forest vegetation and cover types. Both the Interim Land Cover and Copper River Land Cover datasets are based on Landsat Multispectral Sensor (MSS) satellite imagery with an original resolution of 80 meters. The Copper River Land Cover data contains more detailed information on shrub and herbaceous communities than the Interim Land Cover Program and the Chugach NF Timber Type datasets. The ALARM datasets are based in part on interpretation of Landsat MSS imagery and aerial photography but have been generalized considerably; the minimum mapping unit used in the ALARM program was 640 acres. Each dataset used to compile this data layer uses a different vegetation classification scheme, a result of intended use and method of data automation. All but the Chugach National Forest Timber Type database use modifications of the Alaska Vegetation Classification scheme (Viereck et al. 1992). Pacific GIS developed a cross-walk from the vegetation types in each data source to the closest equivalent vegetation type in the Alaska Vegetation Classification scheme to provide a common classification that can be used across the ecosystem.",

The Chugach National Forest Timber Type database is a timber oriented vegetation layer based on interpretation of aerial photography. It is the most detailed digital vegetation information available for substantial areas within the greater Prince William Sound ecosystem. The database contains detailed information about timbered areas including species composition, stand density, stocking levels, stand class size, and volume. Many of these timber- oriented descriptions can be useful as surrogates for important ecological variables such as structural information about a given stand. The database also contains less detailed information on non-forest vegetation and cover types.",

The USGS EROS Alaska Field Office developed the Interim Land Cover dataset which is based on Landsat Multispectral Sensor (MSS) satellite imagery with an original resolution of 80 meters. Pacific GIS developed a cross-walk from the interim land cover vegetation types to the closest equivalent vegetation type in the Alaska Vegetation Classification scheme to provide a common classification that can be used across the ecosystem for various sources of vegetation data. This common classification has been added to the original classification information.",

Vegetative species information and related canopy cover data was collected from ground plots. Plots have been classified using the Alaska Vegetation Classification Scheme. All plots have been referenced on Alaska High Altitude Color Infrared photography at 1:63360 scale. The collection of this data was supported by the regional fire program to provide ground information as to fire fuels for Wrangell St. Elias National Park. These plots have been used for other applications as supportive information for landcover mapping, habitat interpretations, general vegetation knowledge, etc. A Vegetation Survey effort has been underway at the park for approximately 12 years and recently has expanded. Rare plant surveys are currently being conducted as well. All collection points are now spatially referenced with GPS systems.",

Sea\n     ice drifts to the right of the local wind, at angles ranging from 10 degree to 63\n     degree . The response to wind forcing is largest near the ice edge, both over\n     the middle portions of the shelf and along the southern margins of the seasonal\n     ice zone and during strong and steady wind of several days' duration. The\n     large wind-driven response of ice drift observed in this study, in comparison\n     with the Arctic, may result from (1) reduced levels of internal ice stress\n     associated with the generally thin ice cover and lower areal concentration of\n     sea ice, (2) large atmospheric drag coefficients associated with the small ice\n     floes in areas of comparatively higher ice concentration, and (3) smooth ice\n     bottom caused by melting. In nearshore areas the ice to wind coupling is\n     reduced owing to larger internal ice stresses experienced locally due to ice\n     pileup.",

Processing is continuous \nbeginning 3 December 1991,  and continues the series begun with F8 monthly \naveraged data. Although a high degree of correlation exists between F8 and F11 \ndata (Abdalati et al. 1995), regression coefficients (NSIDC 1995) have been \napplied in deriving F11 daily ice concentrations, which form the basis for \nthis data set. Monthly averaged data files contain ice concentration in \npercent ranging from 0% to 100%. Then, ice concentrations are delineated \nusing 0%, 5%, 10% and 15% as the minimum concentrations included in the \naverages (e.g.: a 5% cutoff sets all data values between 1% and 5% to 0%). \nThese four thresholds accommodate as many potential applications as possible. \nGrids are 8-bit raster images stored in HDF.  Data in compressed tar files are \ndistributed via ftp, on sidads.colorado.edu (IP address 128.138.135.20).",

Data are stored in\nHDF and packaged in compressed tar format. These ice concentrations\ncontinue the series begun with DMSP-F8 SSM/I coverage, generated using the\nNASA Team algorithm. Processing is continuous on the F11 data, beginning 3\nDecember 1991.  The DMSP-F8 and -F11 data demonstrate a high degree of\ncorrelation (Abdalati et al. 1995) although regression coefficients are\napplied in the development of F11 ice concentrations in order to maintain\nconsistency of the data set (NSIDC 1995).

An ARC/INFO AML has been developed that extracts single 1:250,000 USGS quadrangles subsets of data and reprojects it to UTM, allowing use of the data at this scale. Associated ASCII files linked to the INFO attribute file contains legal boundary descriptions for each quadrangle. Data is limited to use at a 1:250,000 scale or smaller and is intended for use at a regional or statewide scale for general planning purposes. Site specific evaluation of CZM boundaries should consult more detailed CZM District data sets existing in manual and some in automated form. The Habitat and Restoration Division of The Alaska Department of Fish and Game has a working copy of this data set that is utilized for the coastal zone permitting process.",

Grids represent spatially interpolated data. The interpolation technique maximizes the radiometric integrity of original brightness temperature values, maintain high spatial and temporal precision, and involve no averaging of original swath data. \n\nCoverage is global and spans the Pathfinder SSM/I Benchmark period, from\n1 August 1987 through 30 November 1988.  Resolution is 25 km for all channels \nand 12.5 km for the 85 GHz channels. There are 18 brightness temperature files \nper day for a given projection (nine each for ascending and descending passes), \nand two (ascending and descending) corresponding time files. Data are contained\nin flat binary files, either one image per file consisting of two-dimensional 2-byte integer arrays of brightness temperatures in tenths of Kelvins, or in the case of time files, two-dimensional 1-byte integer arrays consisting of GMT in tenths of hours. \n\nData are available as processing is completed, with completion of the data set projected for the end of 1995. Data are available via ftp, on CD-ROM and through the Internet.  Contact NSIDC User Services for information.",

Activity on state land is recorded, by section, in DNR's Land Administration System (LAS). Note that this is not a parcel database. If parts of a single section fall into different ownership categories, then that section will contain multiple codes (see list below). Thus, a section may appear to have conflicting land status due to the resolution of the data (section on/section off), while at the parcel level, there would be no conflicting land status. Detailed maps by township (state status plats) portraying state land ownership are available at the Public Information Center, Department of Natural Resources. Similar maps (master title plats) portraying federal and native land ownership are available at the BLM Public Room, Bureau of Land Management. Please consult these maps for a more precise location of land ownership, and consult the public land record for current land status information.",

To date nearly 15,000 sites have been recorded within Alaska (however, this is probably only a small percentage of the sites which may actually exist but are as yet unreported.) The fundamental use of the AHRS is to protect cultural resource sites from unwanted destruction.
