The question was large enough to demand the attention of oceanographic disciplines from both countries as well as from others.  After several conferences, it was decided to emphasize the \"Golden Triangle\" (the are encompassed southeastern Bering Sea shelf in an attempt to understand the bioproductivity of this region (Hood and Kelley 1974, Hood and Takenouti 1975).  In the beginning, it appeared most expedient, for logistic and funding reasons, to have each country pursue its part of the program independently.",

Reports in this series may achieve original observations (raw data) or contain preliminary or incomplete data.  These reports do not receive full editorial and peer review.  Reports may be highly individualized.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: Annually\n\nAccess constraints: Requests for one or two pages of data and/or short reports can usually be accommodated.\n\nUse constraints: Republications of materials in this report series may be authorized by the department\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system. NOAA makes no warranty, expressed or implied, nor does the fact of distribution constitute such a warranty.\n\nFGDC metadata date: 19980713\nFGDC metadata contact: Kimberly Bahl\nFGDC metadata standard: Content Standards for Digital Geospatial Metadata (version: FGDC-STD-001-1998)",

The existing weather buoys offer a geographically widespread network for observing the state of B.C.'s coastal ocean and any changes in marine ecosystems resulting from changing climate. The two departments are now working towards the concept of Marine Ecosystem ObServatories (MEOS) , adding new instruments to the buoys for measurements of ocean water properties and key biological fields.The first MEOS buoy has been placed in Saanich Inlet, near the Institute of Ocean Sciences, with easy access for testing and calibrating new sensors and methods. As resources become available, the instruments tested in Saanich Inlet may be added to other buoys in the existing AES/FOC network, or in other specialized locations such as Marine Protected Areas.",

BS FOCI was established to seek understanding of the factors that control abundance of fish populations, with a specific goal of reducing uncertainty in resource management decisions through ecological research on walleye Pollock and stock structure in the Bering Sea.  Using a competitive process, BS FOCI awarded research components to academic scientists from several universities and to scientists from NOAA's Alaska Fisheries Science Center and Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory.  BS FOCI developed collaborations with Russian, Korean and Japanese scientists.  The National research Council (1994) reviewed accomplishments and plans of  BS FOCI.",

The dataset has reformatted detailed data, any errors discovered corrected and extra information added to produce one complete dataset for the whole sampling period. This dataset contains total zooplankton wet weights/m3 for the whole period 1956 to 1980, as well as densities for five major taxa (copepods, chaetognaths, euphausiids, amphipods and Aglantha) from 1964 to 1967 and species identifications, counts and lengths for many samples collected between 1968 to 1980. Document comes with a diskette containing the corrected detailed zooplankton data, methods used to collect and process the data and other pertinent information about the data.",

The U.S. Department of the Interior's Minerals Management Service (MMS) has held four OCS lease sales in the Bering Sea.  More than $100 million has been spent on environmental studies to support OCS lease-sale proposals in the Bering Sea region.  Major issues and concerns associated with OCS exploration activities have been identified and migrated.  Twenty-four exploratory wells have been drilled without finding commercial quantities of oil or gas.  Except for the North Aleutian basin, where there have been no exploration drilling, there is limited interest in future near-term leasing and exploration opportunities in the Bering Sea OCS.  The MMS environmental studies effort has been significantly reduced in the Bering Sea, with the exception of completion of certain studies and monitoring of protected species as part of other ongoing studies.",

The composition, structure, interannual dynamics and function of the pelagic and demersal communities were studied on a macroecosystem scale.  This work was primarily undertaken by the Laboratory of Applied Biocenology (I.e. ecology) and the Laboratory of Research of Plankton of Far-Eastern Seas.  Ecosystem investigations were included as part of fishery research and were supported by a research vessel.  The mission of the first expedition in 1983 was conducted until 1985, with pelagic surveys starting after 1986.  Eleven expeditions have been completed.",

Data collected include surface total carbon dioxide, alkalinity, nutrients, chlorophyll a, carbon-13 in seawater, and atmospheric carbon-13. Underway measurements include position, time, temperature and salinity. Skaugran samples and data were collected 3-4 times daily by scientific staff and once daily by ship`s engineers until 1999, then were reduced to daily engineer`s samples. Alligator Hope samples were collected 3 times daily.",

            "description": "Bristol Bay is considered a nursery area for Pacific halibut and was closed to\n     commercial halibut fishing from 1967 to 1989. In the summer of 1987 the\n     International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) conducted a survey in\n     Bristol Bay to assess the commercial stock size of halibut and the incidence of\n     sublegal fish. Three vessels fished the coastal area from Cape Newenham to\n     Cape Seniavin. The catch per unit effort was 6 pounds, well below the catch\n     per unit effort observed in other areas of the Bering Sea. The catch of\n     sublegal halibut was low; less than 0.5 halibut per unit effort. The survey\n     results suggested that a limited commercial fishery in Bristol Bay would not\n     have an adverse impact on juvenile stocks. The IPHC extended the regulatory\n     Area 4E boundary to allow commercial fishing in Bristol Bay in 1990. Fishing\n     success has been poor compared to other areas and the number of vessels\n     reporting landings in the fishery decreased from 97 in 1990 to 19 in 1992.\n     Annual Bristol Bay catches have ranged from 14,000 to 26,000 pounds.",

            "description": "New experiments are reported that extend previous studies of the internally generated variability found when the Hamburg LSG Ocean General Circulation Model is integrated under mixed  boundary conditions. All model integrations have stochastic forcing added to the freshwater flux to  excite the variability. It is demonstrated that the salinity anomalies that propagate around the meridional circulation of the Atlantic Ocean are merely signals emitted from the source of the variability in the Southern Ocean; they do not play an active role in its generation. It is the Southern Ocean flip\uff96flop oscillator, as suggested by a previous study, that is the driving mechanism of the 320-yr period oscillations. A second mode of propagation is identified that may be related to the\nperiodicity of the oscillations: westward propagation of upper-ocean salinity anomalies around the coast of Antarctica. It is shown that this mode is driven by the same density-upwelling wave motion as reported elsewhere in the literature.\n\n       The sensitivity of the simulated variability to changes in some of the model\uff92s numerical and physical algorithms is investigated. The computationally expensive step of retriangularizing the  matrix equation for the barotropic velocity can be done very infrequently without affecting the characteristics of the variability. Changing to a connective overturn parameterization that leaves  fewer residual instabilities has a small effect on the variability, while changing to one that mixes,  rather than interchanges, statically unstable water masses can reduce the magnitude of the  variability by up to 70%. The latter change, however, is attributed entirely to the different  freshwater flux forcing that the new parameterization implies. Using a more realistic haline and\nthermal coupling between sea ice and the ocean also leads to greatly reduced internal variability on  the 320-yr timescale. Again, changes in surface fluxes implied by the alteration to the model are important, and these changes have implications for the flux adjustments necessary when the LSG  model is coupled to an atmosphere model. The results presented here indicate considerable scope for reducing such flux adjustments.",

The contaminant of greatest concern is mercury (Hg), in light of the high levels of this element reported in some marine sediments and organisms of the sea and contiguous fluvial estuaries. We hypothesize that several unique environmental conditions, coupled with high natural supply of terrigenous Hg, result in high bioaccumulation of this element in marine organisms of the Bering Sea region with ultimate potential risk to commercial and subsistence users.  The primary objective of the study is to check whether the concentrations of Hg in some commercial and subsistence organisms in the Bering Sea are at levels that pose a risk to the organisms and are unacceptable for human consumption. To fulfill this objective we will analyze the concentrations of total Hg [Hg(t)] and its more toxic form, methylmercury (MeHg), in\nselected commercial and subsistence organisms of the Bering Sea (salmon, king crab, and clams). This study deals with issues considered a high priority by the Bering Sea Marine Research Plan (1998) as well as by several state and federal agencies and Bering Sea native groups.\n\nThis project also includes;\n\nJohn Kelley \nSchool of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences\n245 O'Neill Building\nUniversity of Alaska Fairbanks\nFairbanks, AK 99775-7220\n\nAn NPMR project",

We plan to place two closely spaced moorings on the shelf of the Gulf of Alaska about 60 km offshore of Seward. One mooring will monitor temperature, salinity and horizontal velocities, and the other will monitor surface meteorological conditions, nitrate levels, sinking particulate matter, fluorescence and light levels. This study, in conjunction with the present GLOBEC monitoring study in the Gulf of Alaska, will permit us to understand the relation between physical forcing and higher trophic levels (marine mammals, birds, and fish).\n\nThis project also includes;\n\nSusan Henrichs \nUniversity of Alaska Fairbanks\n\nTerry Whitledge\nUniversity of Alaska Fairbanks\n\nAn NPMR project",

            "description": "The Bering Sea responds strongly to major changes in atmospheric forcing. This response is vividly illustrated by the record warm sea surface temperatures that occurred in summer 1997, and the strong mixing in spring 1998. The spring 1998 mixing was due to intense storminess after nearly a decade of reduced storm activity. A large part of this variability is associated with large-scale atmospheric teleconnection modes that fluctuate on monthly to decadal time scales. The modes of particular importance to the Bering Sea during the cool season are the Pacific-North American pattern (PNA) and the Arctic  Oscillation (AO). The AO is receiving great interest because its persistent phase since about 1989 may be related to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases. Less work has been done on the atmospheric variability during the biologically active warm season, but one mode, the North Pacific pattern (NP), seems to be\nespecially important to the Bering Sea. The NP undergoes considerable decadal variability and appears to be linked to ENSO.   The goal of our work is to establish the dynamic relationships between the large-scale changes in the climate system (as\nencapsulated by the teleconnection indices) and the high-frequency, local forcing of the Bering Sea, especially with regard to sea ice, ocean transport and mixed-layer ocean\nprocesses. This research relies upon the daily data available from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis for the period 1958 to the present. Our work will reveal the extent to which air-sea interactions in the Bering Sea are predictable, and the probable changes in these\nair-sea interactions that accompany shifts in the climate system.  Our results will provide a firm climate context for the further study of historical changes in biological populations.\n\nAn NPMR project",

            "description": "We seek understanding of the dynamic response of the Gulf of Alaska shelf to a distributed coastal buoyancy influx and downwelling winds. Simple process-type numerical models will be used to resolve the basic dynamic balances and capture the\ncross-shelf circulation pattern. Parameter ranges used in modeling will encompass  seasonal variations in winds, buoyancy, and stratification of the Alaska Coastal Current (ACC). Results should shed light on a number of issues relevant to\nthe ecosystems of the Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea. We seek to provide a physical explanation for the observed high biological productivity of this deep shelf. The basis for this production is enigmatic given that downwelling winds prevail throughout most of the year and that the shelf receives a massive coastal influx of nutrient-poor freshwater. The ACC appears to be a crucial habitat for young-of-the-year salmon migrating to the ocean. Physical processes within the ACC could enhance the aggregation of zooplankton and therefore be critical to salmon recruitment success. Passive tracers will be introduced into the model to mimic zooplankton and/or young-of-the-year salmon. The dispersion of these tracers will show how these organisms are either retained within the ACC or dispersed outside this current. The results should benefit fisheries biologists seeking to understand salmon  recruitment processes that depends upon survival during their first year. Finally, the ACC plays a crucial role in the freshwater balance of the Gulf of Alaska and possibly the Bering Sea shelf, which lies downstream of the Gulf of Alaska and ultimately receives the ACC. The major focus of the proposed work is on the processes that control the along- and cross-shore transport of freshwater and, conversely, the onshore transport of nutrient-rich, high salinity water from offshore.\n\nThis work will be performed by a graduate student (William J. Williams).\n\nAn NPMR project",

            "description": "The southeastern Bering Sea shelf is an economically and ecologically important ecosystem subject to considerable natural variability. This variability influences the magnitude of primary production and its vertical and horizontal distribution which, in turn, influences the productivity of higher trophic levels over a large range of temporal and spatial scales. Nutrients are vital to maintain the elevated biomass observed on the shelf and must be continually injected into the euphotic zone to counter losses of phytoplankton to grazing, advection and burial. We focus here on exploring physical processes at the shelf edge and outer shelf, particularly instabilities and eddies in the Bering Slope Current that result in the advection of nutrient rich waters onto the shelf. While such processes have been observed to occur, their impact on the Bering Sea shelf ecosystem has yet to be described.\n\nWe will use altimeter data from remote sensing to describe mesoscale circulation variability and to identify episodic events of onshelf flow. Satellite tracked drifters will be released to monitor currents and the temporal evolution of ocean color along the slope. One sampling expedition per year for two years will provide detailed information on the dynamics of the Bering Slope Current/Aleutian North Slope Current (BSC/ANSC) system and on bio-optical relationships between phytoplankton biomass and ocean color. Finally, the stability of the BSC/ANSC system will be examined using an analytical, jet-turning-a-corner model. This research will provide collaborating researchers a regional\ncontext within which to interpret contemporaneous drifter, hydrographic, biological, and bio-optical data acquired from the shelf/slope region of the southeastern Bering Sea.\n\nThis project also includes;\n\nEdward Cokelet \nPacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, NOAA \n7600 Sand Point Way NE\nSeattle, WA 98115\ncokelet@pmel.noaa.gov\n\nTerry Whitledge \nUniversity of Alaska Fairbanks \n\nStephen Okkonen \nUniversity of Alaska Fairbanks\n\nAn NPMR project",

The method has\nnumerous advantages over other more common approaches that use ratios of stable isotopes and stomach content analyses. It will test hypotheses presented in the ReFER (Regime Forcing and Ecosystem Response) conceptual model that diets of populations\nof conspecific seabirds differ between oceanic and shelf habitats and that differences in diet account for opposite trends in abundance at the Pribilof Islands (shelf habitat) compared to Bogoslof Island (oceanic habitat). As part of the study, we will develop an inventory of fatty acid profiles of key forage species in the region that will be useful for diet studies of not only seabirds, but of trophically related marine mammals including sea lions, fur seals, and harbor seals. We will develop a protocol for obtaining biopsy samples of live birds, reducing their mortality rates from diet research.",

            "description": "The recent theoretical approach of Visbeck, Marshall, and Jones is used to examine shallow convection and offshore transport of dense water from an idealized coastal polynya. A constant  negative buoyancy flux is applied in a half-elliptical region adjacent to a coastal boundary, surrounded by a forcing decay region with uniform width W over which the imposed buoyancy flux decreases smoothly to zero. Initially, the density beneath the forcing increases linearly with time. A  baroclinically unstable front forms at the edge of the forcing region. The width of the front is  imposed by the width of the forcing decay region, provided this distance is larger than the  baroclinic Rossby radius. Baroclinic eddies, whose velocities are inversely proportional to W,  develop along the front and exchange dense water from the forcing region with ambient water,\neventually reaching an equilibrium in which the lateral buoyancy flux by eddies balances the prescribed surface buoyancy flux. The time to reach equilibrium te and the equilibrium density  anomaly e are given by where B0 is the imposed buoyancy flux, b the offshore width of the constant forcing region, H the  water depth, f the Coriolis parameter, 0 a reference density, and g the gravitational acceleration.  Finally,  = [/2E(1  b2/a2)]1/2, where a is the length of the constant forcing region along the  coast,  is the efficiency of eddy exchange, and E is the complete elliptic integral of the second\n kind. These parameter dependencies are fundamentally different from previous results for deep or shallow convection (1/2 power rather than 1/3 or 2/3) owing to the influence of the forcing decay  region. The scalings are confirmed with numerical calculations using a primitive equation model.  Eddy exchange in shallow convection is several times more efficient than in open-ocean deep convection. Some implications for Arctic coastal polynyas are discussed",

            "description": "The standard model for sea ice dynamics treats the ice pack as a visco\uff96plastic\nmaterial that flows plastically under typical stress conditions but behaves as a linear\nviscous fluid where strain rates are small and the ice becomes nearly rigid. Because of\nlarge viscosities in these regions, implicit numerical methods are necessary for time\nsteps larger than a few seconds. Current solution methods for these equations use\niterative relaxation methods, which are time consuming, scale poorly with mesh\nresolution, and are not well adapted to parallel computation. To remedy this, the\nauthors developed and tested two separate methods. First, by demonstrating that the\nviscous-plastic rheology can be represented by a symmetric, negative definite matrix\noperator, the much faster and better behaved preconditioned conjugate gradient\nmethod was implemented. Second, realizing that only the response of the ice on\ntimescales associated with wind forcing need be accurately resolved, the model was\nmodified so that it reduces to the viscous-plastic model at these timescales, whereas\nat shorter timescales the adjustment process takes place by a numerically more\nefficient elastic wave mechanism. This modification leads to a fully explicit numerical\nscheme that further improves the model\uff92s computational efficiency and is a great\nadvantage for implementations on parallel machines.\n\nFurthermore, it is observed that the standard viscous-plastic model has poor\ndynamic response to forcing on a daily timescale, given the standard time step (1 day)\nused by the ice modeling community. In contrast, the explicit discretization of the\nelastic wave mechanism allows the elastic-viscous-plastic model to capture the ice\nresponse to variations in the imposed stress more accurately. Thus, the\nelastic-viscous-plastic model provides more accurate results for shorter timescales\nassociated with physical forcing, reproduces viscous-plastic model behavior on longer\ntimescales, and is computationally more efficient overall.",

During these observations several corals were collected and three colonies were made available for an age and growth study.  The colonies examined in this study were identified as bubblegum coral (Paragorgia sp.), precious pink coral (Corallium sp.), and bamboo coral (Keratoisis sp.).  Age was estimated from growth zone counts made in skeletal cross sections.  These age estimages were used to estimate growth rates, and ultimately colony age and perhaps longevity.  To validate the growth rate estimate from growth zone counts a radiometric method called a lead-210 dating was used to determine an independent growth rate for each colony.  Agreement of growth rates derived from growth zone counts and lead-210 dating were used as an indicator of age estimate accruacy.  Growth rates determined for each species were quire different.  The bubblegum coral had a relatively high growth rate, with the precious pink coral being somewhat intermediate and the bamboo coral being the slowest growing\n\n[ Co-PIs: Gregor M.

            "description": "A prominent year-round ensemble response to a global sea surface\n     temperature (SST) anomaly field fixed to that for January 1992 (near the\n     peak of a major warm El Ni\ufff1o\uff96Southern Oscillation episode) was observed\n     in a 20-yr integration of the general circulation model used for operational\n     seasonal prediction by the U.S. National Weather Service. This motivated a\n     detailed observational reassessment of the teleconnections between strong\n     SST anomalies in the central equatorial Pacific Ocean and Pacific\uff96North\n     America region 700-hPa heights and U.S. surface temperatures and\n     precipitation. The approach used consisted of formation of monthly mean\n     composites formed separately from cases in which the SST anomaly in a key\n     area of the central equatorial Pacific Ocean was either large and positive or\n     large and negative. Extensive permutation tests were conducted to test null\n     hypotheses of no signal in these composites. The results provided a\n     substantial case for the presence of teleconnections to either the positive- or\n     negative-SST anomalies in every month of the year. These signals were\n     seasonally varying (sometimes with substantial month to month changes) and,\n     when present for both SST-anomaly signs in a particular month, usually were\n     not similarly phased patterns of opposite polarity (i.e., the SST\uff96teleconnected\n     variable relationships were most often nonlinear).\n\n       A suite of 13 45-yr integrations of the same model described above was\n     run with global SST analyses reconstructed from the observational record.\n     Corresponding composites from the model were formed and compared\n     visually and quantitatively with the high-confidence observational signals. The\n     quantitative comparisons included skill analyses utilizing a decomposition that\n     relates the squared differences between two maps to phase correspondence\n     and amplitude and bias error terms and analyses of the variance about\n     composite means. For the latter, in the case of the model runs it was possible\n     to estimate the portions of this variance attributable to case to case variation\n     in SSTs and to internal variability. Comparisons to monthly mean maps and\n     analyses of variance for the 20-yr run with SSTs fixed to January 1992 values\n     were also made.\n\n       The visual and quantitative comparisons all revealed different aspects of\n     prominent model systematic errors that have important implications for the\n     optimum exploitation of the model for use in prediction. One of these\n     implications was that the current model\uff92s ensemble responses to SST forcing\n     will not be optimally useful until after nonlinear correction of\n     SST-field-dependent systematic errors.

Reports in this series may achieve original observations (raw data) or contain preliminary or incomplete data.  These reports do not receive full editorial and peer review.  Reports may be highly individualized.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: Annually\n\nAccess constraints: Requests for one or two pages of data and/or short reports can usually be accommodated.\n\nUse constraints: Republications of materials in this report series may be authorized by the department\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system. NOAA makes no warranty, expressed or implied, nor does the fact of distribution constitute such a warranty.\n\nFGDC metadata date: 19980713\nFGDC metadata contact: Kimberly Bahl\nFGDC metadata standard: Content Standards for Digital Geospatial Metadata (version: FGDC-STD-001-1998)",

            "description": "A dynamic-thermodynamic sea ice model is developed and coupled with\n     the Melbourne University general circulation model to simulate the seasonal\n     cycle of the Antarctic sea ice distribution. The model is efficient, rapid to\n     compute, and useful for a range of climate studies. The thermodynamic part\n     of the sea ice model is similar to that developed by Parkinson and\n     Washington, the dynamics contain a simplified ice rheology that resists\n     compression. The thermodynamics is based on energy conservation at the top\n     surface of the ice/snow, the ice/water interface, and the open water area to\n     determine the ice formation, accretion, and ablation. A lead parameterization\n     is introduced with an effective partitioning scheme for freezing between and\n     under the ice floes. The dynamic calculation determines the motion of ice,\n     which is forced with the atmospheric wind, taking account of ice resistance\n     and rafting. The simulated sea ice distribution compares reasonably well with\n     observations. The seasonal cycle of ice extent is well simulated in phase as\n     well as in magnitude. Simulated sea ice thickness and concentration are also\n     in good agreement with observations over most regions and serve to indicate\n     the importance of advection and ocean drift in the determination of the sea ice\n     distribution.",

            "description": "A global analysis of in situ observations of sea surface temperature (SST)\n     developed for use at the Canadian Meteorological Center is described. The\n     analysis is done on the anomaly, the departure from Climatology. The anomaly\n     plus Climatology, or resulting SST, is used as the lower boundary condition by\n     the numerical weather prediction model. Since there is no ocean model to\n     provide a background or first-guess field for the analysis, and since anomalies\n     are observed to persist over long periods, the background field is obtained\n     essentially by assuming persistence of the previous anomaly. The analysis\n     algorithm is statistical interpolation. Attention is focused on techniques to\n     control the quality of the observations, including a technique to remove\n     systematic errors from ship observations. The analysis resolution is 0.9\u00b0 and\n     the correlation e-folding distance is 212 km. Verification of the analysis is\n     presented using independent data from buoys and expendable\n     bathy-thermographs for a one-year period. Verification is also presented for\n     the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP, Washington)\n     weekly analysis and for Climatology. Results indicate that the analysis has skill\n     over Climatology in all regions and skill over the NCEP weekly analysis in the\n     North Atlantic. In the rest of the Northern Hemisphere, analysis error\n     estimates for the two analyses are similar, while in the Southern Hemisphere\n     the NCEP analysis is superior, probably due to its use of satellite data. It is\n     intended that this analysis will be an essential component of a debiasing\n     algorithm for satellite SST observations.",

            "description": "Like tree rings, the growth increments in the axial rod of sea pens may reflect long time series of environmental influence. An axial rod is the simple, unbranched endoskeleton of sea pens, which are octocorals that occur in all oceans from shallow to abyssal depths. The formation of these increments, however, is not well described. Twelve rods were extracted from sea pen colonies collected in the Bering Sea. Colonies were selected by total length: 25-29 cm, 99-124 cm, and 153-167 cm. First, rod growth was hypothesized from rod morphology and internal microstructure. Rod shape did not change with overall size suggesting isometric growth. Examination of the internal microstructure, however, suggested that colonies burrow deeper into the sediment with age so that the first-formed part of the calcified rod is at or near the base. Recent accretions likely cover all but the basal end of the rod. Thus, simple transverse sections taken just above the base, to avoid rugose material, should reveal most of the colony\uff92s growth history. Second, the number of growth increments, each comprised of a translucent and opaque zone, was found to vary with rod length, position along the rod, and magnification. At 16x, these increments averaged 0.08 mm (\uffb1 0.005 SE). However, at 100x, it was evident that each \uff93increment\uff94 was actually comprised of finer, c. 0.03-mm wide, increments. Higher magnification did not reveal any further nesting. The maximum number of increments was 132. Finally, an attempt was made to determine the temporal periodicity of growth zone interpretations, the decay of 210Pb over the length of a colony was analyzed. Lead-210 activities in a series of cores extracted from locations along the axial rod ranged from 0.691 \uffb1 0.036 to 2.76 \uffb1 0.13 dpm/g. Because 210Pb activity did not follow a pattern of decay over the length of the colony, a growth rate and corresponding age could not be determined.  \n\n[ An NPMR project ]  [ Co-PIs: Gregor M.

            "description": "To date, most lower trophic level research on the eastern Bering Sea shelf has concentrated on the role of the spring diatom bloom as the main annual production event. Over the Middle Shelf Domain, primary and secondary productions occur throughout the summer supported by regenerated nutrients. During this period, standing stock of chlorophyll is relatively low (0.5 - 2 \u00b5g/l). Periodic outbreaks of diatoms can occur in response to erosion of the pycnocline and injection of nitrate and silicate into the surface waters. Between these outbreaks, nano- and microzooplankton (<200 \u00b5m) are hypothesized to dominate nutrient cycling. During these periods microzooplankton may also provide the intermediary link between small flagellated primary producers and food for juvenile fishes. Recent recurring \"blooms\"\nof the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi require us to achieve a better understanding of summertime nutrient recycling and trophic transfer so that we can predict the effect, if any, E. huxleyi will have on higher trophic levels. We plan to dissect the summer pelagic food web and nutrient cycle of the Middle Shelf Domain to determine the relative contribution of microzooplankton to these processes. Specifically we will investigate nutrient cycling and trophic transfer during two distinct phytoplankton communities: small flagellates (coccolithophores or other species) and diatoms. Juvenile Pollock, a nodal species in the Bering Sea ecosystem, forage on particle-grazing mesozooplankton and variations in summer food supply may affect their ability to accumulate energy stores for the harsh Subarctic winters.\n\nThis project also includes;\n\nEvelyn Lessard \nUniversity of Washington \n\nJeffrey Napp \nAlaska Fisheries Science Center, NOAA \n7600 Sand Point Way NE\nSeattle, WA  98115\njeff.napp@noaa.gov\nAn NPMR project",

            "description": "To date, most lower trophic level research on the eastern Bering Sea shelf has concentrated on the role of the spring diatom bloom as the main annual production event. Over the Middle Shelf Domain, primary and secondary productions occur\nthroughout the summer supported by regenerated nutrients. During this period, standing stock of chlorophyll is relatively low (0.5 - 2 \u00b5g/l). Periodic outbreaks of diatoms can occur in response to erosion of the pycnocline and injection of nitrate and silicate\ninto the surface waters. Between these outbreaks, nano- and microzooplankton (<200 \u00b5m) are hypothesized to dominate nutrient cycling. During these periods microzooplankton may also provide the intermediary link between small flagellated primary producers and food for juvenile fishes. Recent recurring \"blooms\"\nof the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi require us to achieve a better understanding of summertime nutrient recycling and trophic transfer so that we can predict the effect, if any, E. huxleyi will have on higher trophic levels. We plan to dissect the summer pelagic food web and nutrient cycle of the Middle Shelf Domain to determine the relative\ncontribution of microzooplankton to these processes. Specifically we will investigate nutrient cycling and trophic transfer during two distinct phytoplankton communities: small flagellates (coccolithophores or other species) and diatoms. Juvenile Pollock, a nodal species in the Bering Sea ecosystem, forage on particle-grazing mesozooplankton and variations in summer food supply may affect their ability to accumulate energy stores for the harsh Subarctic winters.\n\nThis project also includes;\n\nEvelyn Lessard \nUniversity of Washington \n\nJeffrey Napp \nAlaska Fisheries Science Center, NOAA \n7600 Sand Point Way NE\nSeattle, WA  98115\njeff.napp@noaa.gov\nAn NPMR project",

The Aleutian low intensified and there was a warming of the sea surface adjacent to North America and a cooling offshore. Associated with this change was a period of exceptional fish production. Strong year classes and above-average survival occurred for many commercially important species all along the west coast of Canada and the United States. Trends in total salmon catches increased primarily from increased salmon production in Alaska. Some stocks of maturing pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha), Coho (O. kisutch), and Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) also had above-average growth in 1977. A majority of commercially important nonsalmon species that\nspawned from California to the Bering Sea and have a wide range of life\n     history types also had exceptional strong year classes from 1976 to 1978",

            "description": "Our objective is to put in place a monitoring program for the eastern North Pacific and southern Bering Sea region. Large scale changes in Pacific salmon populations in all regions of North America have been related to climate change in this century. The likely initial cause is changes in the structure of the ocean and atmosphere. These changes are known to affect the abundance, productivity, and community structure of continental shelf and open ocean plankton communities. Changes in plankton\nabundance have been related to the changes in salmon abundance, and reduced ocean productivity is probably the causal link leading to poor ocean survival for salmon.\nClimate changes experienced in recent years are consistent with expectations from models for early stages of global warming. In all regions of the West Coast of North America there have been extremely sudden changes in the productivity of salmon populations. These changes have not been expected from the standard fisheries management theories, nor could they be forecast from available data. However, the changes have had devastating economic impacts on coastal communities from Oregon to (most recently) Alaska. The pattern of failure in year-class strength of Bristol Bay\nsockeye salmon and other stocks and species demonstrates that the cause of the\nsudden downturn has in large part a marine origin. However, salmon spend part of their life history in both coastal and oceanic marine environments, and are therefore subject to environmental changes occurring in both regions. \n\nWe seek to put in place a monitoring framework using the Hardy Continuous  Plankton Recorder (CPR). This is an established technology widely used in the North Atlantic. The\nchanges that the Atlantic CPR program have documented in the 1990s are now being linked to the decline in Atlantic salmon populations, that are also experiencing substantially increased ocean mortality.\n\nOur project involves sampling of the plankton in multiple regions of the offshore and coastal regions of the eastern North Pacific and southern Bering Sea. The monitoring lines will (a) sample the plankton along the coastal migration routes of the juvenile salmon in four locations, (b) quantify the distribution and abundance of shelf plankton populations in the Atlantic (Steele 1998; the relationship of shelf to offshore populations is unclear in the Pacific because of a lack of data), and (c) permit cross-comparisons with almost all existing eastern Pacific ocean surveys (CalCOFI in California; Line P in Canada; and GAK-1 near Seward, Alaska).\n\nThis project also includes; Dr. Sonia Batten, Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science, 1 Walker Terrace, The Hoe, Plymouth, United Kingdom PL1 3BN,\n44 1752 221-112\nsoba@wpo.nerc.ac.uk\nAn NPMR project",

Two existing ship time commitments in the summer of 1999 will be used to undertake the field research with follow-up laboratory analyses in 1999-2000. Based upon recent work, we expect that sediment-based processes can directly decrease concentrations of nitrate in overlying waters on large, shallow shelves. For example, in a paper recently published in the Journal of Geophysical Research (Vol. 104: 7827-7836, April 15, 1999), we provide evidence that 5 to 20% of nitrate currently brought onto the northern Bering Shelf may be lost through denitrification before export off the shelf in the Chukchi Sea. This sediment-based process therefore can have a significant impact on overall ecosystem fertility, and directly impact the biomass of higher trophic levels sequestered within commercially important fisheries and marine mammal populations utilized for subsistence.  The development of spatially extensive estimates of denitrification rates on the Bering continental shelf will improve our understanding of overall carbon and nitrogen cycling in the productive water, and therefore contribute to the North Pacific Marine Research program's goals of developing predictive capabilities for ecological response to expected global change.

            "description": "Our objective is to put in place a monitoring program for the eastern North Pacific and southern Bering Sea region. Large scale changes in Pacific salmon populations in all regions of North America have been related to climate change in this century. The likely initial cause is changes in the structure of the ocean and atmosphere. These changes are known to affect the abundance, productivity, and community structure of continental shelf and open ocean plankton communities. Changes in plankton\nabundance have been related to the changes in salmon abundance, and reduced ocean productivity is probably the causal link leading to poor ocean survival for salmon.\nClimate changes experienced in recent years are consistent with expectations from models for early stages of global warming. In all regions of the West Coast of North America there have been extremely sudden changes in the productivity of salmon populations. These changes have not been expected from the standard fisheries management theories, nor could they be forecast from available data. However, the changes have had devastating economic impacts on coastal communities from Oregon to (most recently) Alaska. The pattern of failure in year-class strength of Bristol Bay\nsockeye salmon and other stocks and species demonstrates that the cause of the\nsudden downturn has in large part a marine origin. However, salmon spend part of their life history in both coastal and oceanic marine environments, and are therefore subject to environmental changes occurring in both regions. \n\nWe seek to put in place a monitoring framework using the Hardy Continuous  Plankton Recorder (CPR). This is an established technology widely used in the North Atlantic. The\nchanges that the Atlantic CPR program have documented in the 1990s are now being linked to the decline in Atlantic salmon populations, that are also experiencing substantially increased ocean mortality.\n\nOur project involves sampling of the plankton in multiple regions of the offshore and coastal regions of the eastern North Pacific and southern Bering Sea. The monitoring lines will (a) sample the plankton along the coastal migration routes of the juvenile salmon in four locations, (b) quantify the distribution and abundance of shelf plankton populations in the Atlantic (Steele 1998; the relationship of shelf to offshore populations is unclear in the Pacific because of a lack of data), and (c) permit cross-comparisons with almost all existing eastern Pacific ocean surveys (CalCOFI in California; Line P in Canada; and GAK-1 near Seward, Alaska).\n\nThis project also includes; Dr. Sonia Batten, Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science, 1 Walker Terrace, The Hoe, Plymouth, United Kingdom PL1 3BN,\n44 1752 221-112\nsoba@wpo.nerc.ac.uk\nAn NPMR project",

The U.S. Congress intends that NPMR studies lead to greater understanding of ecosystem dynamics in the North Pacific Ocean, and the transfer of useful findings to people and groups who have an economic, social, or moral stake in the long-term health of the region. Users of the\ninformation include the scientific community, policy makers, resource managers, marine industries (especially the commercial fishing industry), conservationists, subsistence users, and the general public.  Part one of this project is a 12-installment radio series based on NPMR areas of study. The series will be broadcast on Alaska Public Radio stations and on other broadcast outlets in and outside Alaska. The stories will explain key physical, chemical, and biological phenomena in the ecosystem to provide the public with a good understanding of the basic make-up and dynamics of the North Pacific ecosystem. Possible subjects include the effect of the ice edge on primary production, the effect of sea surface temperature on selected marine animals,\ncirculation and upwelling patterns and their effects on commercially important fish and shellfish, the relationship between climate change and the ecology of marine mammals, and Native perspectives on how specific components of the ecosystem have appeared\nto have changed over the past half century. Each of the 12 radio segments will be 5 minutes long and include high quality digitized sound effects recorded in the field, and first-person interviews with NPMR scientists. Part two of this project will be a classroom guide to the Bering Sea, aimed at junior high/high school level students and teachers. The book will include information covered by the radio series, augmented by additional text, color photos, various figures such as maps and information graphics, and color\nillustrations of North Pacific marine plants and animals and their habitats. The book will include an index of terms and place names, and a glossary of terms.\n\nhttp://www2.sfos.uaf.edu:8080/npmr/projects/data/124/project124.html\n\n\nhttp://www.uaf.edu/seagrant\n\nAn NPMR project",

            "description": "This two-part project will inform the public about NPMR through a radio series about the Bering Sea and a high school/junior high level classroom reference guide to the Bering Sea, both based on NPMR areas of study. The U.S. Congress intends that NPMR studies lead to greater understanding of ecosystem dynamics in the North Pacific Ocean, and the transfer of useful findings to people and groups who have an economic, social, or moral stake in the long-term health of the region. Users of the\ninformation include the scientific community, policy makers, resource managers, marine industries (especially the commercial fishing industry), conservationists, subsistence users, and the general public.  Part one of this project is a 12-installment radio series based on NPMR areas of study. The series will be broadcast on Alaska Public Radio stations and on other broadcast outlets in and outside Alaska. The stories will explain key physical, chemical, and biological phenomena in the ecosystem to provide the public with a good understanding of the basic make-up and dynamics of the North Pacific ecosystem. Possible subjects include the effect of the ice edge on primary production, the effect of sea surface temperature on selected marine animals,\ncirculation and upwelling patterns and their effects on commercially important fish and shellfish, the relationship between climate change and the ecology of marine mammals, and Native perspectives on how specific components of the ecosystem have appeared\nto have changed over the past half century. Each of the 12 radio segments will be 5 minutes long and include high quality digitized sound effects recorded in the field, and first-person interviews with NPMR scientists. Part two of this project will be a classroom guide to the Bering Sea, aimed at junior high/high school level students and teachers. The book will include information covered by the radio series, augmented by additional text, color photos, various figures such as maps and information graphics, and color\nillustrations of North Pacific marine plants and animals and their habitats. The book will include an index of terms and place names, and a glossary of terms.\n\nhttp://www2.sfos.uaf.edu:8080/npmr/projects/data/124/project124.html\n\n\nhttp://www.uaf.edu/seagrant\n\nAn NPMR project",

The approach is a retrospective study of growth and survival of chum and pink salmon stocks from diverse locations including western Alaska. The operating hypothesis is that, because fluctuating ocean climate differs from\nwest to east in the historical record, salmon productivity (growth and survival) should also have varied concordantly, both in historical and spatial scales. Over thirty years of data suitable for testing this hypothesis and alternatives are available in archives of\nproduction statistics and scales. The method will entail retrospective time series analyses of salmon production and climate variation and will entail an analysis of spatial patterns of salmon production. Through this analysis we expect to identify factors affecting growth and survival of salmon from different parts of their range across the Subarctic Pacific.\n\nThis project also includes;\n\nWilliam Smoker \nUniversity of Alaska Fairbanks \n\nWilliam Heard \nAuke Bay Laboratory, Alaska Fisheries Science Center, NOAA \n\nPeter Hagen \nAlaska Department of Fish and Game \npeterh@adfg.state.ak.us\n\n\nCollaborators include Masahide Kaeriyama of Hokkaido Tokai\nUniversity, and Leonid Klyashtorin, VINRO, Russian Federation.\nAn NPMR project",

The results of this study are designed to supplement new and ongoing research in the Bering Sea and North Pacific, addressing several of the NPMR issues including monitoring, forage fish and apex community ecology, and effects of climate change on the biology of the systems. This study falls in the categories of remote sensing and field studies.\n\nA lidar produces short pulses of laser light which pass through the water's  surface and reflect off biological features in the water column, and processes the returning signal. When mounted along with a video camera in a down-looking configuration from the\nbelly of an aircraft, we can use the combined data to produce a three dimensional array of the biological features. When conducted over ground survey transects that include\noceanography, net catches, acoustics, and bird and mammal counts, the processed lidar and video images can be properly interpreted and related to ocean conditions. We propose to overfly ground survey transects, collect continuous spatial data within each\ntransect, and replicate the surveys both during the day and at night. We plan to conduct these surveys synoptic with ongoing ground survey programs (including Inner Fronts, US GLOBEC and/or Ocean Carrying Capacity).\n\nThis technique could overcome many of the shortcomings of traditionally applied technology. \nThose include: \n1) the lack of spatial resolution, \n2) difficulty in performing synoptic data collection, \n3) a mismatch in comparing temporal and spatial scale (due to the speed of vessels versus the time frame of biological activity bursts or diurnal patterns), and \n4) high cost (ground surveys can be reduced). In California, lidar surveys have been\nevaluated for assessments of pelagic sardines and anchovy as a way to reduce the shipboard time involved due to the low relative cost of remote sensing at high speeds.\n\nIn order to fully evaluate this  technique in Alaskan waters, we intend to conduct surveys in two separate oceanographic regions, namely the Bering Sea and northern regions of the Pacific Ocean adjacent to the Alaskan coast. \n\nThis project also includes;\n\nBrenda Norcross \nUniversity of Alaska Fairbanks \n\nJames Churnside \nEnvironmental Technology Laboratory, NOAA\nAn NPMR project",

            "description": "We will conduct a pilot study on the use of airborne lidar (Light Detecting And Ranging) and 3-chip digital video to assess epipelagic biological features such as forage fish\nschools, zooplankton, large individual fish (e.g., salmon), marine mammals and seabirds. The results of this study are designed to supplement new and ongoing research in the Bering Sea and North Pacific, addressing several of the NPMR issues including monitoring, forage fish and apex community ecology, and effects of climate change on the biology of the systems. This study falls in the categories of remote sensing and field studies.\n\nA lidar produces short pulses of laser light which pass through the water's  surface and reflect off biological features in the water column, and processes the returning signal. When mounted along with a video camera in a down-looking configuration from the\nbelly of an aircraft, we can use the combined data to produce a three dimensional array of the biological features. When conducted over ground survey transects that include\noceanography, net catches, acoustics, and bird and mammal counts, the processed lidar and video images can be properly interpreted and related to ocean conditions. We propose to overfly ground survey transects, collect continuous spatial data within each\ntransect, and replicate the surveys both during the day and at night. We plan to conduct these surveys synoptic with ongoing ground survey programs (including Inner Fronts, US GLOBEC and/or Ocean Carrying Capacity).\n\nThis technique could overcome many of the shortcomings of traditionally applied technology. \nThose include: \n1) the lack of spatial resolution, \n2) difficulty in performing synoptic data collection, \n3) a mismatch in comparing temporal and spatial scale (due to the speed of vessels versus the time frame of biological activity bursts or diurnal patterns), and \n4) high cost (ground surveys can be reduced). In California, lidar surveys have been\nevaluated for assessments of pelagic sardines and anchovy as a way to reduce the shipboard time involved due to the low relative cost of remote sensing at high speeds.\n\nIn order to fully evaluate this  technique in Alaskan waters, we intend to conduct surveys in two separate oceanographic regions, namely the Bering Sea and northern regions of the Pacific Ocean adjacent to the Alaskan coast. \n\nThis project also includes;\n\nBrenda Norcross \nUniversity of Alaska Fairbanks \n\nJames Churnside \nEnvironmental Technology Laboratory, NOAA\nAn NPMR project",

            "description": "The Bering Sea supports the largest flatfish fishery in the United States. Productivity in this region is important to the U.S. economy; fisheries from the region constitute 10-40% of the U.S. fisheries harvest. Bottom trawling for flatfish has been common in the Bering Sea since the early 1950s when foreign fishing vessels overexploited yellowfin sole stocks. Mobile fishing gear has recently become the focus of international attention as\nmanagers fear habitat degradation, loss of biological diversity and the subsequent consequences to fishery resources. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSFCMA) requires the identification and description of Essential\nFish Habitat (EFH) for each commercially fished species and any adverse impacts that may affect EFH. However, a paucity of knowledge on trawl impacts on the eastern Bering Sea shelf currently impedes resource managers' ability to address the\nrequirements of the MSFCMA and make informed decisions in this region. \n\nIn collaboration with the Alaska Fisheries Science Center of the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service, and the Groundfish Forum, we will determine if there are measurable impacts of commercial flatfish trawling on EFH of the eastern Bering Sea shelf. \nOur objectives are to 1) compare physical and biological variables between trawled areas and closures to determine chronic impacts 2) conduct experimental trawling in selected closures to determine acute trawling impacts by comparing physical and biological variables 3) determine the severity of trawl impacts compared to natural variation at different depths and substrates across the eastern Bering Sea shelf. \n\nThis project also includes; Sue Hills,  University of Alaska Fairbanks,  P.O.

            "description": "This project addresses the need to integrate top trophic-level predators into interdisciplinary mesoscale and fine-scale process studies of middle trophic levels in the southeast Bering Sea. In collaboration with physical, chemical and biological sampling within the Fisheries-Oceanography Coordinated Investigations (FOCI) and the Midwater Assessment and Conservation Engineering Program (MACE), our survey will provide data to define trophic linkages between middle and upper trophic levels, specifically cetaceans, contributing to effects on community structure and function. Results will define top-down and bottom-up interactions, especially in regard to euphausiids\n(Thysanoessa inermis and T. raschii) and copepods (e.g., Neocalanus cristatus, Neocalanus plumchrus, and Calanus marshallae) which are important forage for upper trophic level predators. Information on the spatial distributions of whales, and estimates of feeding rates, relative to interannual variability in the productivity and physical forcing in the system, will be used to estimate rates of energy transfer upward from middle trophic levels. Models of trophic interactions and carbon flow within the systems will greatly benefit from these data. Predation may also be a factor that explains swarming and schooling of zooplankton and fish, thus further explaining discontinuities of prey distributions. Finally, in addition to the mesoscale survey, we will focus specific sampling and foraging aggregations of whales, which act as natural integrative plankton recorders. Our survey defines mesoscale variability in zooplankton biomass across the shelf from the shelf-edge to the Inner Front. From the bottom-up perspective, we propose to test the hypothesis that physical processes and variation in prey density do not affect the occurrence patterns of top trophic level predators in the southeast Bering Sea shelf; or that there is no threshold of prey density that can just be reached before the distribution of predators is affected. Alternately, from the top-down perspective,\nwe hypothesize that average swarm/school characteristics, as assessed by acoustic and net sampling (i.e. size, depth, density, shape), remain the same regardless of densities and behavior of predators in the vicinity.    \n\n[ An NPMR project ]  [ Reference: Tynan, C.T. 2004.

            "description": "The population of the Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus), an apex predator in the North Pacific and Bering Sea ecosystems, has continuously declined over the past two\ndecades along the Aleutian Islands and in the Gulf of Alaska.  Steller sea lions are now listed as threatened within their eastern  Alaskan range, and as endangered in their western range, under the Endangered Species Act. Despite years of productive research,  little is known about the extent to which a hypothesized reduction in juvenile survival--in turn possibly related to reduced prey abundance--contributes to the present population trends.  We will accurately measure survival rates in juvenile Steller sea\nlions at two locations of a declining population, along the Aleutian Islands and in the Gulf of Alaska. For the first time, our approach will also deliver longitudinal dive effort data spanning several years, as well as detailed dive behavior data from non-surviving\nsea lions, and thus from the very animals that presumably contribute most to the population decline. Survival rates and long-term dive effort data will be determined through the use of satellite-linked mortality transmitters (SMXs), implanted into 60\nfreeranging young-of-the-year Steller sea lions. As a central part of our project, we will directly test the hypothesized reduction in juvenile Steller sea lion survival.  Our experimental design utilizes a new paradigm for testing additional specific hypotheses pertinent to the decline of Stellers: a previously impossible direct comparison between survivors and non-survivors. We will analyze the relationship between early body mass and condition, health, as well as pollution indicators,  near-weaning dive behavior and performance, continued long-term foraging effort and the survival of individual juvenile\nSteller sea lions. The analysis of seasonal, interannual and ontogenetic changes and variability in dive effort and mortality, as well as of detailed dive effort prior to death, will allow us to assess the relative effects of reduced foraging efficiency, nutritional\nstress, and possibly predation on survival. Furthermore, we will assess the extent to which juvenile survival can be predicted by parameters that can be measured in young Stellers prior to weaning. Such a predictive analysis might become a powerful tool\nin the assessment of future population trends before they become obvious at the population level. Our cooperative project--which integrates interdisciplinary research on population dynamics, foraging ecology, physiology, health, and contaminants--directly addresses key issues and implements specific recommendations of the Bering Sea\nEcosystem Research Plan Draft, the Steller Sea Lion Recovery Plan, several workshops on Steller sea lion issues, as well as NPMR. These diverse plans identify needs on Steller sea lion research, highlighting long-term longitudinal monitoring and\njuvenile survival as two of the most central and pressing issues.\n\nAn NPMR project",

Evidence suggests links between low juvenile survival and nutrient limitations (i.e. diets of low quantity, quality, and diversity). Diets of Steller sea lions are diverse and include species of primary and secondary importance to commercial fisheries in Alaska. Thus\nfishing activity in haulout areas is assumed to negatively effect the ability of Steller sea lions to secure food. Based primarily upon assumptions about Steller sea lion foraging behavior and prey/habitat use, the National Marine Fisheries Service recently implemented legislation that disallows trawl fishing in 10 nmi radii around Steller sea lion haulouts. We hypothesize that the relative composition and abundance of prey species in the diet of Steller sea lions is directly related to availability of prey around critical haulouts in the Kodiak area. The location of Kodiak Island is central to the decline in the number of Steller sea lions and the local fishing industry is greatly impacted by the newly imposed no-trawl \"buffer zones\" around Steller sea lion haulouts.  Our project involves determining seasonal Steller sea lion abundance, distribution (through monthly aerial surveys), and diet (through quarterly scat collection) in the Kodiak Island region. Simultaneously, we will determine temporal (seasonal and annual) and spatial (10 and 20 nmi) composition, abundance and distribution of prey around five critical haulouts on the eastern side of Kodiak Island. We will compare the use of prey by Steller sea lions to seasonal and annual availability of prey both inside and outside of the buffer zones. These data ultimately will be of practical importance to fisheries managers and will provide basic knowledge of predator/prey dynamics in the Kodiak Island region.\nThis project also includes;  Brenda Norcross, bnorcross@ims.uaf.edu; Sue Hills, shills@ims.uaf.edu;  Loren Buck, cbuck@uaf.edu, Robert Foy, foy@ims.uaf.edu\n\nAn NPMR project",

            "description": "The Bering Sea responds strongly to major changes in atmospheric forcing. This response is vividly illustrated by the record warm sea surface temperatures that occurred in summer 1997, and the strong mixing in spring 1998. The spring 1998 mixing was due to intense storminess after nearly a decade of reduced storm activity. A large part of this variability is associated with large-scale atmospheric teleconnection modes that fluctuate on monthly to decadal time scales. The modes of particular importance to the Bering Sea during the cool season are the Pacific-North American pattern (PNA) and the Arctic  Oscillation (AO). The AO is receiving great interest because its persistent phase since about 1989 may be related to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases. Less work has been done on the atmospheric variability during the biologically active warm season, but one mode, the North Pacific pattern (NP), seems to be\nespecially important to the Bering Sea. The NP undergoes considerable decadal variability and appears to be linked to ENSO.   The goal of our work is to establish the dynamic relationships between the large-scale changes in the climate system (as\nencapsulated by the teleconnection indices) and the high-frequency, local forcing of the Bering Sea, especially with regard to sea ice, ocean transport and mixed-layer ocean\nprocesses. This research relies upon the daily data available from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis for the period 1958 to the present. Our work will reveal the extent to which air-sea interactions in the Bering Sea are predictable, and the probable changes in these\nair-sea interactions that accompany shifts in the climate system.  Our results will provide a firm climate context for the further study of historical changes in biological populations.\n\nAn NPMR project",

            "description": "We seek understanding of the dynamic response of the Gulf of Alaska shelf to a distributed coastal buoyancy influx and downwelling winds. Simple process-type numerical models will be used to resolve the basic dynamic balances and capture the\ncross-shelf circulation pattern. Parameter ranges used in modeling will encompass  seasonal variations in winds, buoyancy, and stratification of the Alaska Coastal Current (ACC). Results should shed light on a number of issues relevant to\nthe ecosystems of the Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea. We seek to provide a physical explanation for the observed high biological productivity of this deep shelf. The basis for this production is enigmatic given that downwelling winds prevail throughout most of the year and that the shelf receives a massive coastal influx of nutrient-poor freshwater. The ACC appears to be a crucial habitat for young-of-the-year salmon migrating to the ocean. Physical processes within the ACC could enhance the aggregation of zooplankton and therefore be critical to salmon recruitment success. Passive tracers will be introduced into the model to mimic zooplankton and/or young-of-the-year salmon. The dispersion of these tracers will show how these organisms are either retained within the ACC or dispersed outside this current. The results should benefit fisheries biologists seeking to understand salmon  recruitment processes that depends upon survival during their first year. Finally, the ACC plays a crucial role in the freshwater balance of the Gulf of Alaska and possibly the Bering Sea shelf, which lies downstream of the Gulf of Alaska and ultimately receives the ACC. The major focus of the proposed work is on the processes that control the along- and cross-shore transport of freshwater and, conversely, the onshore transport of nutrient-rich, high salinity water from offshore.\n\nThis work will be performed by a graduate student (William J.

            "description": "We seek understanding of the dynamic response of the Gulf of Alaska shelf to a distributed coastal buoyancy influx and downwelling winds. Simple process-type numerical models will be used to resolve the basic dynamic balances and capture the\ncross-shelf circulation pattern. Parameter ranges used in modeling will encompass  seasonal variations in winds, buoyancy, and stratification of the Alaska Coastal Current (ACC). Results should shed light on a number of issues relevant to\nthe ecosystems of the Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea. We seek to provide a physical explanation for the observed high biological productivity of this deep shelf. The basis for this production is enigmatic given that downwelling winds prevail throughout most of the year and that the shelf receives a massive coastal influx of nutrient-poor freshwater. The ACC appears to be a crucial habitat for young-of-the-year salmon migrating to the ocean. Physical processes within the ACC could enhance the aggregation of zooplankton and therefore be critical to salmon recruitment success. Passive tracers will be introduced into the model to mimic zooplankton and/or young-of-the-year salmon. The dispersion of these tracers will show how these organisms are either retained within the ACC or dispersed outside this current. The results should benefit fisheries biologists seeking to understand salmon  recruitment processes that depends upon survival during their first year. Finally, the ACC plays a crucial role in the freshwater balance of the Gulf of Alaska and possibly the Bering Sea shelf, which lies downstream of the Gulf of Alaska and ultimately receives the ACC. The major focus of the proposed work is on the processes that control the along- and cross-shore transport of freshwater and, conversely, the onshore transport of nutrient-rich, high salinity water from offshore.\n\nThis work will be performed by a graduate student (William J. Williams).\n\nAn NPMR project",

            "description": "The southeastern Bering Sea shelf is an economically and ecologically important ecosystem subject to considerable natural variability. This variability influences the magnitude of primary production and its vertical and horizontal distribution which, in turn, influences the productivity of higher trophic levels over a large range of temporal and spatial scales. Nutrients are vital to maintain the elevated biomass observed on the shelf and must be continually injected into the euphotic zone to counter losses of phytoplankton to grazing, advection and burial. We focus here on exploring physical processes at the shelf edge and outer shelf, particularly instabilities and eddies in the Bering Slope Current that result in the advection of nutrient rich waters onto the shelf. While such processes have been observed to occur, their impact on the Bering Sea shelf ecosystem has yet to be described.\n\nWe will use altimeter data from remote sensing to describe mesoscale circulation variability and to identify episodic events of onshelf flow. Satellite tracked drifters will be released to monitor currents and the temporal evolution of ocean color along the slope. One sampling expedition per year for two years will provide detailed information on the dynamics of the Bering Slope Current/Aleutian North Slope Current (BSC/ANSC) system and on bio-optical relationships between phytoplankton biomass and ocean color. Finally, the stability of the BSC/ANSC system will be examined using an analytical, jet-turning-a-corner model. This research will provide collaborating researchers a regional\ncontext within which to interpret contemporaneous drifter, hydrographic, biological, and bio-optical data acquired from the shelf/slope region of the southeastern Bering Sea.\n\nThis project also includes;\n\nEdward Cokelet \nPacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, NOAA \n7600 Sand Point Way NE\nSeattle, WA 98115\ncokelet@pmel.noaa.gov\n\nTerry Whitledge \nUniversity of Alaska Fairbanks \n\nStephen Okkonen \nUniversity of Alaska Fairbanks\n\nAn NPMR project",

            "description": "Recent declines in some species of marine organisms in the Bering Sea have spurred an interest in evaluating causes and predicting long-term impacts of these changes.  Red-legged kittiwakes (Rissa brevirostris) and black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) are two species of top-level predators that have declined since the mid-1970s at colonies in the Pribilof Islands, site of the largest breeding concentrations of seabirds in the southeastern Bering Sea. In contrast, Kittiwake populations have increased over\nthe same period at Bogoslof Island, 300 km south of the Pribilofs. Ocean climate trends\nand changes in marine food webs have been listed as likely causes of changes in seabird populations, but relationships between environmental factors and seabird\npopulation fluctuations are difficult to study directly. Nevertheless, it is important to understand causal mechanisms. We propose to compare kittiwake population parameters at the Pribilofs and Bogoslof. The Pribilof Islands lie on the continental\nshelf and are surrounded by water less than 200 m deep, whereas the much deeper\nwater of the basin surround Bogoslof.  We plan to test the hypothesis that divergent trends in abundance of kittiwakes (Rissa spp.) at two locations in the southeastern Bering Sea are related to differences in community structure and food web production. Specifically we will evaluate whether two parameters of reproduction, productivity (e.g., chicks/pair) and chick growth rates, are higher at Bogoslof than in the Pribilofs. Furthermore, we will evaluate historic patterns of population change, timing of nesting events, and various reproduction parameters (e.g., clutch size, laying success, hatching success, fledging success, chick growth) to evaluate correlation with environmental factors. This proposal is part of a multidisciplinary project called \"Regime Forcing and Ecosystem Response ReFER.\" It compliments and will benefit from an ongoing\nseabird-monitoring program in the Pribilof Islands funded by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nAn NPMR project",

            "description": "Recent declines in some species of marine organisms in the Bering Sea have spurred an interest in evaluating causes and predicting long-term impacts of these changes.  Red-legged kittiwakes (Rissa brevirostris) and black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) are two species of top-level predators that have declined since the mid-1970s at colonies in the Pribilof Islands, site of the largest breeding concentrations of seabirds in the southeastern Bering Sea. In contrast, Kittiwake populations have increased over\nthe same period at Bogoslof Island, 300 km south of the Pribilofs. Ocean climate trends\nand changes in marine food webs have been listed as likely causes of changes in seabird populations, but relationships between environmental factors and seabird\npopulation fluctuations are difficult to study directly. Nevertheless, it is important to understand causal mechanisms. We propose to compare kittiwake population parameters at the Pribilofs and Bogoslof. The Pribilof Islands lie on the continental\nshelf and are surrounded by water less than 200 m deep, whereas the much deeper\nwater of the basin surround Bogoslof.  We plan to test the hypothesis that divergent trends in abundance of kittiwakes (Rissa spp.) at two locations in the southeastern Bering Sea are related to differences in community structure and food web production. Specifically we will evaluate whether two parameters of reproduction, productivity (e.g., chicks/pair) and chick growth rates, are higher at Bogoslof than in the Pribilofs. Furthermore, we will evaluate historic patterns of population change, timing of nesting events, and various reproduction parameters (e.g., clutch size, laying success, hatching success, fledging success, chick growth) to evaluate correlation with environmental factors. This proposal is part of a multidisciplinary project called \"Regime Forcing and Ecosystem Response ReFER.\" It compliments and will benefit from an ongoing\nseabird-monitoring program in the Pribilof Islands funded by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nAn NPMR project",

            "description": "This project will expand the scope of the Alaska Native Harbor Seal Commission's (ANHSC) present biological sampling efforts to include subsistence hunters in communities west of Prince William Sound. The Commission is a tribal consortium\nconcerned with self-management of the harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) as a subsistence resource. The ANHSC already conducts a biological sampling program in nine communities and participates in the harvest data assessment program with the\nAlaska Department of Fish and Game Subsistence Division. We plan to expand this effort to nine more communities in western Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. Local technicians are selected and trained by the Commission's staff to perform basic necropsies on seals taken by subsistence hunters. Samples from these seals are sent to the University of Alaska Museum (UAM) for distribution to ongoing investigations and for archiving in the permanent collections.  Tissue samples will be archived in the Alaska Frozen Tissue Collection (AFTC) which has become the primary regional archive for frozen zoological samples and a major contributor to environmental studies of the North Pacific and Arctic oceans. It is now the world's third largest frozen tissue collection for wild mammals (Hafner et al. 1997). The increasingly powerful tools of molecular biology and biochemistry and the need to monitor perturbation of the environment are accelerating both collection growth and usage. In addition to supporting expanded\nmonitoring and sampling by the ANHSC, this project supports additional student help at UAM to process the increased number of samples. This project will increase the scope of sampling from a protected and potentially threatened high-trophic-level subsistence resource, and increase the scope of Native involvement in the study and management of marine resources.

We worked closely with people leading the Canadian Northern Contaminants Program, learning from their experience.\nWe decided that the most effective way to make information available to Alaska Natives and to interested government and university researchers is an interactive computer database. Three years ago many villages could not effectively access the internet. We therefore designed the database to work on individual computers. And, to avoid requiring Native villages to purchase special software, we designed the database to run on its own compiled version of Microsoft Access and Visual Basic. The database contains information on existing measures of contaminants in species of fish and animals harvested by Alaska Natives, harvest and consumption data, nutrition data, descriptions of the role of harvest and Native food consumption in communities, and examples of community initiatives taken in response to concerns about environmental change. The reader can see an overview of the Contaminants and Native Foods Database on the web at: www.nativeknowledge.org.",

            "description": "\"It is clear that a complex suite of significant interrelated, atmospheric, oceanic, and terrestrial changes has occurred in the Arctic in recent decades.  This event is affecting every part of the arctic environment and is having repercussions on society. There is evidence that these changes are connected with the rising trend  in the Arctic Oscillation (AO), a mode of atmospheric variability that is potentially active over a broad range of time scales, including climatic time scales, and that involves changes in the strength of the atmospheric polar vortex. There is theoretical evidence that the positive trend observed in the AO index might be indicative of greenhouse warming. It is unclear what feedback processes on climate or ecosystems may be involved in the recent changes, or what the long-term impacts may be. However, observations suggest the impact at high latitudes is substantial and the impact at middle latitudes is significant. Because the observed changes have made it harder for those who live in the North to predict what the future may bring, we have given the name Unaami (the yup'ik word for \"tomorrow\") to the complex of intertwined, pan-arctic changes.\"",

Regardless\n     of divergence, the large-scale flow exports everywhere water vapor, water,\n     and heat from an atmospheric box within the boundary layer. In the case of\n     the water vapor budget this export and the loss by condensation in clouds are\n     compensated by evaporation from the sea surface. Both the condensation in\n     clouds and surface evaporation increase in downstream direction, as does\n     their ratio from about 0.4 near the ice edge to about 0.8 at distances greater\n     than 300 km.\n\n       In the water budget, the source by condensation in clouds is compensated\n     by two sinks: large-scale flow export and precipitation. Precipitation\n     increases absolutely from about 1\uff964 mm day1 in downstream direction but\n     the ratio of precipitation versus condensation remains approximately constant\n     at a value of 0.75.\n\n       In contrast to the water vapor and water budgets with only one source, the\n     heat budget has several sources, namely, surface heat flux, entrainment heat\n     flux, condensation in clouds, and possibly radiation, which compensate for the\n     heat export by the large-scale flow. The relative importance of these sources\n     changes with distance from the ice edge. Near the ice edge, the surface heat\n     flux at the first place and the entrainment flux at the second place are the\n     relevant sources, while farther downstream in the region of deep\n     convection\uff97latent heat release by condensation is the dominating heat\n     source. Here, the surface heat flux is of secondary importance and the\n     entrainment flux plays a minor role.\n\n       Since a systematic transition from roll-like to cellular-like convection\n     patterns is present in Arctic cold-air outbreaks, the differences in the budgets\n     with respect to distance from the ice edge apply as well to the regions of rolls\n     and cells, respectively. It is hypothesized that mesoscale cellular convection\n     with cloud depths of more than 1 km does not occur unless the Bowen ratio\n     is less than about 0.6.",

THE DATA WAS RECORDED TO TWO-WAY TRAVEL-TIMES OF 15 TO 23 SECONDS, WITH 50 TO 75 METER SHOT SPACING. \n\nTWO NORTH-SOUTH TRANSECTS WERE PROFILED. THE EASTERN TRANSECT EXTENDED  FROM 58(50'N, 169(32'W, WELL WITHIN THE CONTINENTAL SHELF OF THE  BERING SEA, NORTH OF THE PRIBILOF ISLANDS, TO JUST SOUTH OF THE SHELF  EDGE NORTH OF BARROW, ALASKA, AT 71(49'N, 154(33'W. ICE PREVENTED CONTINUATION OF THE LINE BEYOND THE SHELF EDGE. THE\nWESTERN TRANSECT  EXTENDED FROM THE CENTRAL CHUKCHI SEA, WELL WITHIN THE SHELF AT  71(23'N, 163(00'W, INTO THE ALEUTIAN BASIN AT 58(00'N, 178(30'W, NEAR  NAVARINSKY CANYON. AN ADDITIONAL SHORT LINE CROSSING OVER THE BERINGIAN MARGIN A SECOND TIME WAS RECORDED NEAR ZEMCHUG CANYON EAST  OF THE WESTERN TRANSECT. \n\nTHE PROFILES CROSS IMPORTANT STRIKE-SLIP FAULTS, POSSIBLE TERRANE  BOUNDARIES, TWO CONTINENTAL MARGINS, AND SEVERAL CRETACEOUS /TERTIARY  SEDIMENTARY BASINS (NORTON, HOPE, CHUKCHI, AND NAVARIN BASINS).  TOGETHER WITH THE PRECEDING CRUISE EW94-09, THE PROFILES PROVIDE A CONTINUOUS TRANSECT ACROSS THE NORTH AMERICAN CONTINENT, FROM THE  PACIFIC TO THE ARCTIC OCEAN (SEE FIGURES 7 THROUGH 9 FOR DATA EXAMPLES).\n\nMOST OF THE MULTI-CHANNEL SEISMIC (MCS) DATA IS OF HIGH QUALITY,  BUT BAD WEATHER, STRONG CURRENTS, AND RECORDING PROBLEMS SOMETIMES  PRESENTED DIFFICULTIES DURING DATA ACQUISITION. GRAVITY, MAGNETIC,  AND SONOBUOY DATA WERE ALSO RECORDED ALONG THE PROFILES. WIDE-ANGLE RECORDING WAS DONE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SEISMIC PROFILING, AT RECORDING SITES LOCATED ALONG THE\n CENTRAL WEST COAST OF ALASKA AND THE CHUKCHI PENINSULA, AS WELL AS ON ISLANDS IN THE BERING STRAIT AND BERING SEA.",

This model contains atmospheric, oceanic, comprehensive\n     sea-ice (dynamic/thermodynamic plus leads), and biospheric submodels. The\n     model control run (over 100 years long) employed flux corrections and\n     displayed only a small amount of cooling, mainly at high latitudes. The\n     transient experiment (1% increase in CO2 compounding per annum) gave a\n     2\u00b0C warming at time of CO2 doubling. The model displayed a \uff93cold start\uff94\n     effect with a (maximum) value estimated at 0.3\u00b0C. The warming in the\n     transient run had an asymmetrical response as seen in other coupled models,\n     with the Northern Hemisphere (NH) warming more than the Southern\n     Hemisphere (SH). However, the land surface response in this model is\n     different from some other transient experiments in that there is not a\n     pronounced drying of the midlatitudes in the NH in summer.\n\n       In the control run the ice model gave realistic ice distributions at both poles,\n     with the NH ice in particular displaying considerable interdecadal variability.\n     In the transient run the ice amount decreased more in the NH than the SH\n     (corresponding with a greater NH warming). The NH ice extent and volume\n     in summer was considerably reduced in depth and extent compared to the\n     control. However, the model ice dynamics and thermodynamics allowed for a\n     successful regrowth of the ice during the winter season to give a coverage\n     comparable to that of the control run, although thinner.\n\n       During the transient run there is a freshening of the surface salinity in the\n     oceans at high latitudes. In the SH this is caused mainly by increases in\n     precipitation over evaporation. The same is true for the NH, but it is found\n     that there is a similar magnitude contribution to the polar freshening from ice\n     melt and land runoff changes. The freshening in the North Atlantic reduces the\n     strength of the meridional overturning by 35% at time of doubling of CO2.\n     Other changes in the global climate at the end of the transient run relative to\n     the control run are also investigated.",

            "description": "Bristol Bay is considered a nursery area for Pacific halibut and was closed to\n     commercial halibut fishing from 1967 to 1989. In the summer of 1987 the\n     International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) conducted a survey in\n     Bristol Bay to assess the commercial stock size of halibut and the incidence of\n     sublegal fish. Three vessels fished the coastal area from Cape Newenham to\n     Cape Seniavin. The catch per unit effort was 6 pounds, well below the catch\n     per unit effort observed in other areas of the Bering Sea. The catch of\n     sublegal halibut was low; less than 0.5 halibut per unit effort. The survey\n     results suggested that a limited commercial fishery in Bristol Bay would not\n     have an adverse impact on juvenile stocks. The IPHC extended the regulatory\n     Area 4E boundary to allow commercial fishing in Bristol Bay in 1990. Fishing\n     success has been poor compared to other areas and the number of vessels\n     reporting landings in the fishery decreased from 97 in 1990 to 19 in 1992.\n     Annual Bristol Bay catches have ranged from 14,000 to 26,000 pounds.",

            "description": "Surface ozone (O3) and its precursors in rural and urban areas of Hong\n     Kong are analyzed through the seasonal, temporal, and spatial variation\n     patterns. The seasonal O3 shows a unique pattern with a major peak in\n     autumn and a trough in summer. The spring and winter seasons are the\n     transition periods with a relatively small peak in spring. The seasonal\n     alternation of the prevailing oceanic and continental air masses, plus the\n     climate system associated with the Asian monsoon system, are the governing\n     factors for the temporal O3 pattern in Hong Kong. The O3 imported by these\n     air masses is found to be the dominating factor for the fluctuation of ambient\n     O3 in Hong Kong. The aged air masses associated with the continental\n     outflow from China carry with them anthropogenic air pollutants emitted from\n     the blooming industrial and urban neighborhoods north of Hong Kong in\n     Guangdong Province, China. Under favorable meteorological conditions for\n     photochemical O3 formation in southeast China, the O3 level reaches a\n     maximum in autumn. The absence of a local urban or a summer O3 peak\n     suggests that the local O3 formation is not the dominant source of O3 in\n     summer. The absence of an elevated ground-level O3 peak in the spring\n     season is an indication that the stratospheric intrusion process of O3 is not a\n     significant source of surface O3 in Hong Kong. The authors\uff92 analysis also\n     shows that the emission of O3 precursors from motor vehicles and the\n     complex topography within the territories has a local effect on the spatial O3\n     distribution and diurnal O3 pattern in Hong Kong.",

The\n     authors applied a forward stepwise program to derive linear multiple\n     regression equations that explained 81% of the variance of H by means of\n     only 3.5 variables, averaged over all months and grid points. The stability of\n     these equations held up well on 6 yr of independent data in terms of explained\n     variance, root-mean-square error, and the spatial anomaly correlation\n     coefficient. Therefore, it seems feasible to reconstruct maps of H for the first\n     half of the twentieth century as a function of data on P and T only.",

This lack of knowledge is of particular concern given the potential for degradation of habitats resulting from increased offshore and Prince William Sound shipping activities. Low-altitude aerial shoreline surveys at high tide every two to three days across the Delta, are being used to estimate phenology, relative abundance and distribution of shorebirds in spring.",

The purpose is to detect population trends over time for these species. National Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) protocol point count methods are used on all three districts of the Chugach National Forest to conduct annual neotropical migratory bird counts on an annual basis. In the Cordova Ranger District, permanent monitoring stations have been established on four point count transects and 2 BBS routes. Surveys have been conducted in these areas between 1992-1994. The Glacier District operates spring and fall banding and a MAPS (Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survival) station in Portage Valley. Seward Ranger District ran USFWS BBS route. Data is entered into a DBASE format and submitted to the Neotropical Monitoring Data Center in Redwood Science Laboratory, Arcata , California as part of and agreement with Region Ten USFS. These surveys will be conducted indefinitely as part of USFS contribution to the National Database. Contacts for individual districts are Steve Babler Cordova District, Cliff Fox, Glacier District, Bill Shuster, Seward District.",

These new atlases are\n     compared with previously published 5\u00b0 \uffd7 5\u00b0 coarse resolution maps of 1 for\n     the Northern Hemisphere and the South Atlantic and with a 1\u00b0 \uffd7 1\u00b0\n     fine-resolution map of c1 for the tropical Pacific. It is concluded that the\n     methods used in these earlier estimates yield values that are biased\n     systematically low by 5%\uff9615% owing to seemingly minor computational\n     errors. Geographical variations in the new high-resolution maps of c1 and 1\n     are discussed in terms of a WKB approximation that elucidates the effects of\n     earth rotation, stratification, and water depth on these quantities. It is shown\n     that the effects of temporal variations of the stratification can be neglected in\n     the estimation of c1 and 1 at any particular location in the World Ocean.\n     This is rationalized from consideration of the WKB approximation.",

Rotated principal components (time series) derived\n     from this analysis are related to anomalies of seasonal-mean global sea\n     surface temperature, and monthly mean Northern Hemisphere 500-hPa\n     geopotential height and sea level pressure (SLP).\n\n       Wintertime seasonal-mean precipitation in California is captured by two\n     RPCs. The first RPC documents coherent precipitation anomalies centered in\n     northern California, Oregon, southern Idaho, and eastern Washington, and\n     explains the largest portion of area-averaged variance of any of the patterns in\n     the decomposition. A second RPC captures coherent precipitation variability\n     in the south coast and southeast desert regions of California, southern\n     Nevada, southern Utah, and northern Arizona. Fluctuations in the first RPC\n     correlate poorly with Pacific Ocean SST anomalies. However, wet winters in\n     the region of the second RPC correlate modestly with simultaneous cool\n     western subtropical Pacific Ocean SST anomalies and weakly with warm\n     SST anomalies over a broad region of the central and eastern tropical Pacific.\n     The spatial scale of the tropical SST correlation and the prominent\n     multidecadal timescale signal of the RPC are consistent with ENSO\n     fluctuations on this timescale influencing southern California precipitation.\n\n       Consistent with the results of earlier studies, significant correlation are\n     found between California wintertime monthly mean precipitation variability\n     and regional 500-hPa geopotential height and SLP anomalies. Linear\n     regression analysis is used to construct estimates of the total 500-hPa\n     geopotential height and SLP fields (Climatology plus anomaly) that are\n     representative of the extreme wet and dry California winter months; these are\n     then compared with the observed conditions in the individual extreme months.\n     Several different flow patterns appear capable of producing anomalously\n     large monthly precipitation totals in California.",

The CNF database includes owner, status and parcel boundaries for all lands within the CNF boundary. These parcel boundaries are based on legal descriptions, plats, and other sources drafted onto 1:31,680 scale base maps. Pacific GIS used land status records from Alaska DNR for areas outside the CNF boundary (primarily the Copper River basin). The DNR dataset is coarser in resolution (i.e., to the nearest section) than the datasets available through the Chugach NF. Alaska DNR bases their understanding of land status on a statewide digital (but non- geographic) database maintained by the BLM. In general, these records are thematically accurate but do not carry specific parcel boundaries. At a regional level of analysis, the coarse nature of this data is acceptable, but the user should recognize this limitations of this source data. Land ownership and status is dynamic, particularly in Alaska, where land is still being transferred from federal to state and Native corporation ownership, and from state to private ownership under the Alaska Statehood Act, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, and various state homestead and land disposal programs. Due to the many and frequent changes in land ownership and status, Pacific GIS recommends obtaining updated information from the source agencies.",

The shading is a mathematically calculated value to provide the illusion of a terrain surface being illuminated by an implied light source. It is useful as a back- drop for other data because it gives an intuitive view of the landscape.",

A large\n     experiment consisting of 13 45-yr-long integrations forced by prescribed sea\n     surface temperature (SST) variations is analyzed. The predictability of\n     timescales of seasonal to decadal averages is evaluated. The variability of a\n     climate mean contains not only climate signal arising from external boundary\n     forcing but also climate noise due to the internal dynamics of the climate\n     system, resulting in various levels of predictability that are dependent on the\n     forcing boundary conditions and averaging timescales. The focus of this study\n     deviates from the classic predictability study of Lorenz, which is essentially\n     initial condition sensitive. This study can be considered to be a model\n     counterpart of Madden\uff92s \uff93potential\uff94 predictability study.\n\n       The tropical SST anomalies impact more on the predictability over the\n     Pacific/North America sector than the Atlantic/Eurasia sector. In the former\n     sector, more significant and positive impacts are found during El Ni\ufff1o and La\n     Ni\ufff1a phases of the ENSO cycle than during the ENSO inactive period of\n     time. Furthermore, the predictability is significantly higher during El Ni\ufff1o than\n     La Ni\ufff1a phases of the ENSO cycle. The predictability of seasonal means\n     exhibits large seasonality for both warm and cold phases of the ENSO cycle.\n     During the warm phases, a high level of predictability is observed from\n     December to April. During the cool phases, the predictability rapidly drops to\n     below normal from November to March. The spring barrier in the\n     atmospheric predictability is therefore a distinct phenomenon for the cold\n     phase, not the warm phase, of the ENSO cycle. The cause of the barrier can\n     be traced to the smaller climate signal and larger climate noise generated\n     during cold events, which in turn can be traced back to the rapidly weakening\n     negative SST anomalies in the tropical Pacific east of the date line.\n\n       Due to the fact that the signal to noise ratio of this model climate system is\n     very small, an upper bound in atmospheric predictability is present, even\n     when a perfect model atmosphere is considered and large ensemble mean\n     predictions are exploited. The outstanding issues of the dynamical short-term\n     climate prediction employing an atmospheric general circulation model are\n     examined, the current model deficiencies identified, and continuing efforts in\n     model development addressed.",

            "description": "Numerical simulations of terrain-induced turbulence associated with airflow\n     over Lantau Island of Hong Kong are presented. Lantau is a relatively small\n     island with three narrow peaks rising to between 700 and 950 m above mean\n     sea level. This research was undertaken as part of a project to better\n     understand and predict the nature of turbulence and shear at the new airport\n     site on the island of Chek Lap Kok, which is located to the lee of Lantau.\n     Intensive ground and aerial observations were taken from May through June\n     1994, during the Lantau Experiment (LANTEX). This paper focuses on flow\n     associated with the passage of Tropical Storm Russ on 7 June 1994, during\n     which severe turbulence was observed.\n\n       The nature of the environmental and topographic forcing on 7 June 1994\n     resulted in the turbulence and shear being dominated by the combination of\n     topographic effects and surface friction. High-resolution numerical\n     simulations, initialized using local sounding data, were performed using the\n     Clark model. The simulation results indicate that gravity-wave dynamics\n     played a very minor role in the flow distortion and generation of turbulence.\n     As a result of this flow regime, relatively high vertical and horizontal resolution\n     was required to simulate the mechanically generated turbulence associated\n     with Tropical Storm Russ.\n\n       Results are presented using a vertical resolution of 10 m near the surface\n     and with horizontal resolutions of both 125 and 62.5 m over local, nested\n     domains of about 13\uff9624 km on a side. The 125-m model resolution\n     simulated highly distorted flow in the lee of Lantau, with streaks emanating\n     downstream from regions of sharp orographic gradients. At this resolution the\n     streaks were nearly steady in time. At the higher horizontal resolution of 62.5\n     m the streaks became unstable, resulting in eddies advecting downstream\n     within a distorted streaky mean flow similar to the 125-m resolution\n     simulation. The temporally averaged fields changed little with the increase in\n     resolution; however, there was a three- to fourfold increase in the temporal\n     variability of the flow, as indicated by the standard deviation of the wind from\n     a 10-min temporal average. Overall, the higher resolution simulations\n     compared quite well with the observations, whereas the lower resolution\n     cases did not. The high-resolution experiments also showed a much broader\n     horizontal and vertical extent for the transient eddies. The depth of orographic\n     influence increased from about 200 m to over 600 m with the increase in\n     resolution. A physical explanation, using simple linear arguments based on the\n     blocking effects of the eddies, is presented. The nature of the flow separation\n     is analyzed using Bernoulli\uff92s energy form to display the geometry of the\n     separation bubbles. The height of the 80 m2 s2 energy surface shows\n     eddies forming in regions of large orographic gradients and advecting\n     downstream.\n\n       Tests using both buoyancy excitation and stochastic backscatter to\n     parameterize the underresolved dynamics at the 125-m resolution are\n     presented, as well as one experiment testing the influence of static stability\n     suppressing turbulence development. All these tests showed no significant\n     effect. Implications of these results to the parameterization of mechanically\n     induced turbulence in complex terrain are discussed.",

This classification system was developed prior to the spill by Minerals Management Services and NOAA. The sensitivity classification divides shorelines into 10 categories 1 being least sensitive to 10 the most sensitive. This depiction has been mapped using ARC/INFO to classify shoreline for each of the three spill affected areas, Prince William Sound (PWS), Cook Inlet (CIK) and Kodiak Island region (KAP). The intended use of this data was for analysis purposes with other resource layers to attempt to model the potential effects of oiling.",

            "description": "Anomalous wave source regions are identified during the life cycles of\n     persistent flow anomalies occurring over the North Pacific and North\n     Atlantic Oceans during boreal winter. These cases project strongly upon the\n     Pacific\uff96North American and Eastern Atlantic teleconnection patterns,\n     respectively, and represent two of the primary modes of intraseasonal low\n     frequency variability in the Northern Hemisphere wintertime circulation. In\n     the upper troposphere, these cases are manifested by wave trains of\n     large-scale and large amplitude flow anomalies extending downstream from\n     key regions near the Aleutian Islands and south of Iceland, respectively. The\n     occurrence of persistent flow anomalies is closely linked to persistent\n     extremes in surface weather and to variations in the skill of extended-range\n     weather forecasts. Black and Dole performed a detailed diagnostic analysis\n     of the onset of persistent cyclonic flow anomalies over the North Pacific. A\n     key result of their study was that wave activity flux diagnoses correctly\n     identified the location of anomalous wave source regions.\n\n       Black and Dole\uff92s study is extended by diagnosing three-dimensional\n     fluxes of wave activity during the onset, maintenance, and decay of cyclonic\n     and anticyclonic persistent flow anomalies over the North Atlantic and North\n     Pacific regions. The flux characterizes large-scale wave propagation, and the\n     flux divergence is used to deduce the location of regional sources and sinks\n     of anomalous wave activity. In all cases there is a marked upward and\n     downstream flux of wave activity emanating from the lower troposphere near\n     the key region. The results are consistent with a local wave source and\n     Rossby-like wave propagation away from the source. There is little evidence\n     that anomalous remote processes directly force persistent flow anomaly life\n     cycles. The diagnostic analyses indicate that the primary anomalous wave\n     sources for both cyclonic and anticyclonic persistent flow anomalies are local\n     to the region of their occurrence. It remains possible, however, that\n     anomalous remote forcing plays an indirect or catalytic role in some cases.",

By the authors\uff92 definition, a \uff93weak wake\uff94 forms when the\n     potential vorticity generated by a mountain is not strong enough to advect\n     itself into eddies; rather, it is simply advocated downstream by the ambient\n     flow. GOES-8 and Landsat sunlit images unambiguously revealed that the\n     mountainous Windward Islands have remarkably long straight wakes. The\n     length of St. Vincent\uff92s wake exceeds 300 km although its width is only 20\n     km. Near the islands, the wake structures reflect the details of the island\n     topography. These wakes do not exhibit any obvious diurnal effect.\n\n       Boat surveys in the lee of St. Vincent confirmed the existence of features\n     seen in the images: the sharp wake boundary, the small valley-induced jet\n     embedded in the near wake, and the absence of any reverse flow. Aircraft\n     surveys gave evidence of descent over the island and showed that the wake\n     air is relatively warm and dry. The length of the wake (L) agrees with the\n     formula L = H/2CD (where H is the wake depth and CD is the surface drag\n     coefficient), implying that the reacceleration of the wake air is caused by the\n     ambient streamwise pressure gradient rather than by lateral entrainment of\n     momentum or geostrophic adjustment.\n\n       Two numerical models were used to simulate St. Vincent\uff92s wake, a\n     single-layer hydrostatic model and a 3D nonhydrostatic model. Both models\n     indicated that air descent, acceleration, wave breaking, and weak potential\n     vorticity generation occur over the island, causing a long straight wake.",

The fall data represented a summary of beached oil concentrations following the completion of all major spill treatment in 1989. Survey dates were from  September 11, 1989 through November 3, 1989. Surveys were conducted by on-site transects, primarily at low tide. ADEC's goal was to map and monitor all known locations of beached oil. Oiling data were verified with ADEC to assure the accuracy of Natural Resources Damage Assessment files. Shorelines were walked by teams of two or three people. Inaccessible areas were surveyed by skiff; no oiling was classified from the air. Each team used a computer generated map from 1:63,630 source material, showing a beach segment on a single page, typically enlarged to a scale of 1:10,000. During this survey information was also recorded on oil penetration, oil thickness, shoreline type, sediment type, location of photographs and sediment samples, quality of oil, location of oiling within the inter-tidal area, and focus damage. The intended purpose of this database is to provide a resource for use in the oil spill damage identification, oil spill response, and future habitat restoration activities.",

The ADEC cumulative shoreline oiling through August 1989 provided NRDA with the most comprehensive shoreline oiling data. These observations were based on fixed-wing, helicopter, and on-site records made by a limited number of trained ADEC personnel and backed by a formal ADEC documentation process. The information represents the cumulative oil impact from March 28, 1989 to the end of the month which was reported.

Pacific GIS obtained the data in this layer from the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill database. The Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) collected the data from September 11, 1989 through November 3, 1989. The 1:63,360 scale  dataset indicates high, medium, and low presence of oil. A related data layer is the Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) data layer (est_esi) from the Alaska DNR Oil Spill Database. The ESI data layer is essentially a classification of coastal geomorphology to allow assessment of the shoreline sensitivity  to and capacity to cleanse itself of oil. Additional shoreline oiling datasets available from Alaska Dept. Nat. Res. include a coverage of cumulative shoreline oiling through August 1989, as well as shoreline oiling coverages for spring 1990 and 1991.",

            "description": "Steady drift of an ice cover produces a vertically sheared current in the\n     upper ocean of the Arctic. Under the ice cover, mesoscale shallow brine and\n     freshening sources generate submerged anticyclones and cyclones,\n     respectively. A submerged eddy extending deep into the water column\n     experiences differential advections by the vertically sheared current.\n     Interaction between subsurface eddies and the sheared current is examined\n     using a three-dimensional numerical model in a coordinate system moving\n     with the ice. The initial salinity field is in geostrophic balance with the sheared\n     current, and a pulse of brine or freshening forcing produces an anticyclone or\n     a cyclone. In a coordinate system moving with the ice, eddies are in a\n     vertically sheared backward ambient current. To an observer looking into\n     the direction of the backward ambient current, eddies move with the current\n     and deflect to the right (left) for counterclockwise (clockwise) rotating\n     eddies in both hemispheres. The lower half of the eddy always moves faster.\n     The lateral movement can be explained by the Kutta\uff96Zhukhovski lift\n     theorem. Differential advection produces eddy tilting and entails the\n     development of a narrow jet following the moving eddy. The jet reduces\n     eddy straining and tilting, and eddies disperse in cases of sizeable tilts.\n     Driven by a vertically sheared current, cyclones are short-lived compared\n     with anticyclones because the lateral movement of a cyclone exposes the\n     lower part of the eddy into waters of weaker stratification. The results help\n     explain the predominance of anticyclonic eddies under the Arctic ice.",

Thirteen formal presentations on marine reserves\n     and fishery refugia catalyzed a lengthy and far-ranging discussion of the\n     potential of refugia as fishery management tools, the strengths and limitations\n     of refugia-based management, existing evidence of refugia efficacy, the need\n     for further testing, and design considerations for fishery refugia. The\n     presentations represented a wide variety of ecological and socioeconomic\n     systems, ranging from tropical coral reef in Western Australia, Florida,\n     Bermuda, and the Cayman Islands, through temperate reef systems in\n     California, New Zealand, and South Australia, to arctic systems in the Bering\n     Sea; crustacean and molluscan fisheries were examined as well as those for\n     temperate and tropical reef finfishes.",

            "description": "The Climate System Model (CSM) consists of atmosphere, ocean, land,\n     and sea-ice components linked by a flux coupler, which computes fluxes of\n     energy and momentum between components. The sea-ice component\n     consists of a thermodynamic formulation for ice, snow, and leads within the\n     ice pack, and ice dynamics using the cavitating-fluid ice rheology, which\n     allows for the compressive strength of ice but ignores shear viscosity.\n\n       The results of a 300-yr climate simulation are presented, with the focus on\n     sea ice and the atmospheric forcing over sea ice in the polar regions. The\n     atmospheric model results are compared to analyses from the European\n     Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and other observational\n     sources. The sea-ice concentrations and velocities are compared to satellite\n     observational data.\n\n       The atmospheric sea level pressure (SLP) in CSM exhibits a high in the\n     central Arctic displaced poleward from the observed Beaufort high. The\n     Southern Hemisphere SLP over sea ice is generally 5 mb lower than\n     observed. Air temperatures over sea ice in both hemispheres exhibit cold\n     biases of 2\uff964 K. The precipitation-minus-evaporation fields in both\n     hemispheres are greatly improved over those from earlier versions of the\n     atmospheric GCM.\n\n       The simulated ice-covered area is close to observations in the Southern\n     Hemisphere but too large in the Northern Hemisphere. The ice concentration\n     fields show that the ice cover is too extensive in the North Pacific and\n     Subarctic North Atlantic Oceans. The interannual variability of the ice area is\n     similar to observations in both hemispheres. The ice thickness pattern in the\n     Antarctic is realistic but generally too thin away from the continent. The\n     maximum thickness in the Arctic occurs against the Bering Strait, not against\n     the Canadian Archipelago as observed. The ice velocities are stronger than\n     observed in both hemispheres, with a consistently greater turning angle (to\n     the left) in the Southern Hemisphere. They produce a northward ice\n     transport in the Southern Hemisphere that is 3\uff964 times the satellite-derived\n     value. Sensitivity tests with the sea-ice component show that both the pattern\n     of wind forcing in CSM and the air-ice drag parameter used contribute to\n     the biases in thickness, drift speeds, and transport. Plans for further\n     development of the ice model to incorporate a viscous-plastic ice rheology\n     are presented.\n\n       In spite of the biases of the sea-ice simulation, the 300-yr climate\n     simulation exhibits only a small degree of drift in the surface climate without\n     the use of flux adjustment. This suggests a robust stability in the simulated\n     climate in the presence of significant variability.",

Pacific GIS filled gaps in the Channel Type Database with stream information from the DNR Oil Spill Database. Stream data for areas outside Prince William Sound was drawn largely from the Alaska DNR ALARM Database. Data obtained from the USGS DLG data is very small scale (1:2,000,000 scale) and is suitable only for an overview of streams within the region. All stream data except that obtained from the Chugach NF Channel Type database include information on presence of anadromous fish, although this information is variable in age and not documented as to source.

            "description": "Data Type: Freshwater Systems;  This data layer is a composite of polygonal surface hydrography data, derived from several different sources at differing scales, organized by 1:250,000 scale USGS quadrangles, and included as a merged layer. This layer covers the Prince William Sound - Copper River ecosystem and includes information on lakes, wide river channels, marine areas, and glaciers. The most detailed stream and lake coverages for Prince William Sound are taken largely from the Chugach National Forest's Channel Type Database (for line features) and the Timber Type Database (for polygonal features).  Pacific GIS filled gaps in these datasets with stream and lake information from the Alaska Department of Natural Resources (DNR) Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Database. Pacific GIS drew stream data for areas outside of Prince William Sound largely from Alaska DNR's Alaska Land and Resource Mapping  (ALARM) database. This dataset is considerably coarser than the hydrography information for Prince William Sound. All stream data, except those obtained from the Chugach National Forest Channel Type Database, include information on presence of anadromous fish, although this information is variable in age and not documented as to source. Pacific GIS merged these datasets used for this quad-by-quad layer to develop a composite surface hydrography layer for the Prince William Sound - Copper River basin ecosystem (hydro_pl in the ecosystem directory). A related data layer, river250 contains stream data for the greater PWS - Copper River ecosystem.",

The\n     model is used to address Arctic numerical modeling with and without climate\n     restoring. The model without climate restoring reproduces basic observed\n     features of the Arctic ice\uff96ocean circulation. The simulated oceanic\n     processes adjust to the surface and lateral fluxes and transport heat and\n     mass in a way that achieves a rough salt and heat balance in the Arctic in the\n     integration period of seven decades. The main deficiency of the model is its\n     prediction of unrealistically high salinity in the central Arctic, which tends to\n     weaken the ocean currents.\n\n       The introduction of corrective salinity and temperature restoring terms has\n     a significant impact on prediction of the ice\uff96ocean circulation in the Arctic.\n     The impact results from a chain reaction. First, the restoring terms change\n     the salinity and thermal states in the oceanic mixed layer and below. The\n     altered density structure, in turn, influences the ocean circulation by altering\n     the ocean\uff92s dynamic and thermodynamic processes. The ocean circulation\n     then affects ice motion and ice thickness by altering the dynamics and\n     thermodynamics of the ice. Restoring only ocean salinity induces a heat\n     surplus or deficit, which causes the oceanic thermal state to drift away from\n     the Climatology. This is also the case with restoring both salinity and\n     temperature in the upper ocean. Only restoring salinity and temperature in\n     the deeper ocean is likely to avoid climate drift in the Arctic.\n\n       This paper points out the problems of using models without climate\n     restoring and the consequences of using models with climate restoring for\n     Arctic ice\uff96ocean modeling. It stresses the need to use a realistic\n     representation of surface fluxes in order to improve prognostic simulations. It\n     also stresses the importance of oceanic processes such as connective\n     overturning and vertical advection both in the Arctic and in the adjacent\n     oceans. If these processes are not reasonably represented, the models can\n     predict over warm intermediate layers in the Arctic and an excessive heat\n     influx at Fram Strait, causing the Arctic ice pack to possibly shrink gradually,\n     a scenario global climate models should avoid.",

Aerial surveys were flown in a Piper PA-18 aircraft in late November 1994 - January 1995. moose habitat was searched at 1.4-2.2 minutes per square mile. Sex and age ratio estimates were obtained from data collected prior to mid-December. Total numbers in most populations were estimated based on densities observed during aerial surveys, percentage of wintering habitat surveyed, and quality of survey conditions. When survey conditions were not complete, population estimates were based on historical trends. Purpose of this data is to monitor moose populations on the Chugach National Forest lands and to use moose as an indicator species of diversity and habitat health.",

            "description": "Puget Sound is modeled as a branched system of two-layered advective reaches separated by mixing zones. Fresh water and salt provide\nconvenient tracers to calculate the annual mean layer transports. The technique utilizes historical records (1951-1956) of runoff and salinity\nwhich are analyzed with the aid of modern (principally 1970's) current meter records to provide the appropriate mass conserving\nlandward- and seaward-flowing layer salinities for each reach. This is the first time that the long-term transports have been estimated\nsimultaneously for the entire Strait of Juan de Fuca/Puget Sound system. With few exceptions the inferred transports agree well with\nestimates derived from scattered, shorter duration current observations. Uncertainties in the transports are estimated from uncertainties in\nthe runoff, velocity profiles and salinities. The results provide the basis for future computations of refluxing and the steady state tracer\nconcentrations and ages in the Sound.",

Tsunami vertical runup measurements varied between 15 and 30 m\nover a 20-km portion of the southern part of Okushiri Island with several 10-m values on the northern portion of the Island. Along the west coast of Hokkaido, no\nsurvey values exceeded 10 m, but damage was extensive at several coastal towns. Given the sudden onset of the tsunami and its high energy, it is amazing that more\npeople were not killed. We also observed that the seawall at Aonae was effective in reducing runup amplitudes.",

            "description": "A dynamic sea ice model based on granular material rheology is\n     presented. The sea ice model is coupled to both a mixed layer ocean model\n     and a one-layer thermodynamic atmospheric model, which allows for an ice\n     albedo feedback. Land is represented by a 6-m thick layer with a constant\n     base temperature. A 10-year integration including both thermodynamic and\n     dynamic effects and incorporating prescribed climatological wind stress and\n     ocean current data was performed in order for the model to reach a stable\n     periodic seasonal cycle. The commonly observed lead complexes, along\n     which sliding and opening of adjacent ice floes occur in the Arctic sea ice\n     cover, are well reproduced in this simulation. In particular, shear lines\n     extending from the western Canadian Archipelago toward the central Arctic,\n     often observed in winter satellite images, are present. The ice edge is well\n     positioned both in winter and summer using this thermodynamically coupled\n     ocean\uff96ice\uff96atmosphere model. The results also yield a sea ice circulation and\n     thickness distribution over the Arctic, which are in good agreement with\n     observations. The model also produces an increase in ice formation\n     associated with the dilatation of the ice medium along sliding lines. In this\n     model, incident energy absorbed by the ocean melts ice laterally and warms\n     the mixed layer, causing a smaller ice retreat in the summer. This cures a\n     problem common to many existing thermodynamic\uff96dynamic sea ice models",

Data will be automated in GIS format for use in the Chugach Forest Plan revision process. This data set's intended use is for baseline data support for project oriented projects being conducted within the forest on the Kenai Peninsula. The Copper River Delta integrated inventory includes landform, soils, and vegetation communities is almost complete. It will be entered into the Chugach GIS system in ARC/INFO format. A general lands system inventory scheduled for completion in 1995 for the entire forest is presently being conducted and includes landforms and sub group soils mapping.",

The software, called the Graphical Resource Database (GRD), is part of Alyeska's commitment to the Prince William Sound Tanker Oil Discharge Prevention and Contingency Plan. The GRD consists of layers of coastal resource digital data records (such as seabird colony sites and sea otter concentration areas) that are linked to points, lines, or polygons depicting animal distributions on computer-generated maps. The expansion and update effort is coordinated by a committee consisting of representatives from federal and state natural resource trustee agencies, citizens oversight groups, Alyeska, and oil shipping companies. The data collection and checking process is conducted in accordance with written standard operating procedures. Data are gathered from the trustee agencies, compiled into Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, and verified using quality control/quality assurance procedures. The spreadsheets are then loaded into a commercially available mapping program, MapInfo , which serves as an intermediate graphical data management tool. The data are transferred from MapInfo to the GRD using FORTRAN programs. Data is available to federal and state agencies for oil spill planning and response.",

            "description": "This paper discusses the behavior of the Arctic Ocean surface air\n     temperature field for 1979\uff9693. Temperatures are derived from a new\n     gridded 6-h, 2-m air temperature dataset called POLES. These gridded air\n     temperatures are estimated from optimal interpolation of temperature inputs\n     from drifting buoys, manned Soviet North Pole (NP) drifting ice stations,\n     coastal land weather stations, and ship reports. In processing the POLES\n     data, the winter and summer properties of the mean NP temperatures are\n     used to discard inaccurate or snow-covered buoys and to remove a summer\n     warm bias. Comparison of the POLES and specific NP temperatures shows\n     that the POLES temperature behaves well and gives better results than other\n     gridded temperature datasets. Maps of the mean seasonal temperatures give\n     realistic results consistent with other published estimates, and plots of the\n     summer advance and retreat of the 0\u00b0C isotherm show the expected\n     asymmetry between advance and retreat associated with the open water\n     formation adjacent to the coasts. Also, comparison of the regional POLES\n     observations of the annual onset of melt and freeze with published estimates\n     derived from visible and passive microwave satellite data gives realistic\n     results. However, problems with the dataset arise in the post-1991 period\n     from the termination of the NP stations and a reduction in the number of\n     Siberian and Alaskan weather stations. In spite of these problems, the paper\n     shows that the POLES dataset provides an improved air temperature field\n     for use in numerical sea ice models and for comparison with satellite\n     datasets.",

NOS publishes digital bathymetric data in two forms: raw depths of all soundings from included bathymetric surveys; and \"gridded\" data. Gridded data is a summarization of raw NOS data information and includes the mean, maximum, and minimum depths recorded in each cell in a 15 second latitude by 15 second longitude grid. The Alaska DNR augmented the NOS gridded data with information from NOAA nautical charts and converted it to bathymetric contours (interval = 20 m) and polygons suitable for shading.

The shoreline data used to cover the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill (EVOS) region is currently shared and held in common by the involved State and Federal agencies. This transaction occurred early on after the spill so subsequent data related to the coastline would be consistently defined. The shoreline data covering PWS was cooperatively sourced from USFS, Chugach Forest Office. The coverage was digitized from the most currently available 1:63360 USGS map series, with the exception of USFS Big Islands Management Area (Green, Montague, Hawkins, Hinchinbrook, and associated satellite islands. The coastline for the Big Islands was derived from Chugach National Forest 1:31,680 timber type maps. These maps were created from 1:15,840 1974 USFS photography. Coastline was determined at mean high tideline. Green Island, Little Green Island and satellite islands were replaced using 1988 USGS 1:63,360 maps. CIK shoreline was purchased from ComRim Systems Inc. at the same scale using USGS basemaps. Information on thousands of small islands and rock outcrops was taken from the Exxon shoreline for PWS and CIK.",

            "description": "The surface temperature field in the Arctic winter is primarily controlled by\n     downward longwave radiation, which is determined by local atmospheric\n     temperature and humidity profiles and the presence of clouds. The authors\n     show that regional differences in the atmospheric thermal energy budget are\n     related to the tropospheric circulation in the Arctic. Data sources include\n     several gridded meteorological datasets and surface and rawinsonde\n     observational data. Four independent climatologies of mean January surface\n     temperature show consistent spatial patterns: coldest temperatures in the\n     western Arctic north of Canada and warmer regions in the Chukchi,\n     Greenland, and Barents Seas. Data from the five winters of 1986\uff9690\n     illustrate the coupling between the surface temperature, the downward\n     longwave radioactive fields, and the tropospheric temperature and humidity\n     fields, with monthly surface\uff96upper-air correlation on the order of 0.6.\n     Upper-level circulation patterns reveal features similar to the surface\n     temperature fields, notably a persistent low center located over northern\n     Canada; the cyclonic flow around the low is a tropospheric extension of the\n     polar vortex. Colder and drier conditions are maintained within the vortex\n     and communicated to the surface through radioactive processes. The polar\n     vortex also steers transient weather systems, the most important mechanism\n     for horizontal heat transport, into the eastern Arctic, which results in as much\n     as 25 W m2 more heat flux into the eastern Arctic than the western Arctic.\n     A reason for the colder temperatures in the western Arctic is that the polar\n     vortex tends to be situated downstream of the northern Rocky Mountains;\n     this preferred location is related to orographic forcing of planetary waves.\n     Monthly and interannual variability of winter temperatures is conditioned by\n     the interaction of the Arctic and midlatitude circulations through the strength\n     and position of the polar vortex.",

            "description": "Recent climate records from ice cores and deep-sea sediments suggest that\n        there has been considerable climate variability in the North Atlantic region\n        over the past 250,000 years. Much of this variability may be linked to changes\n        in thermohaline circulation in the North Atlantic ocean. Model studies have\n        demonstrated that changes in the flux of fresh water to the ocean, resulting\n        from changes in atmospheric transport or the waxing and waning of ice sheets,\n        can have a significant effect on the thermohaline circulation. The authors\n        present model simulations showing that increased flow of fresher North Pacific\n        water through the Bering Strait into the northern North Atlantic can also\n        effect the thermohaline circulation, by suppressing North Atlantic Deep Water\n        formation; however, decreased flow does not necessarily cause deep-water\n        formation to begin again. In the model, flow through the Bering Strait\n        depends on ecstatic sea level and the salinity difference between the North\n        Atlantic and North Pacific oceans. The authors suggest that a higher sea level\n        during the last interglacial period, leading to greater flow through the Bering\n        Strait, may have made the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation more\n        sensitive than it is at present to fluctuations in the hydrological cycle, which\n        may explain recent observations indicating that climate variability was greater\n        then than it is today.",

Intended use of information is to aid CRNA meet criteria to establish permanent rights for Ahtna shareholders to pursue subsistence activities in Wrangell St. Elias National Park and preserve and protect Ahtna subsistence use areas and resources from urban competition. This database is part of a cooperative agreement with NPS and BLM to develop information relevant to Customary and Traditional Use determinations, the establishment of Residential Zones for subsistence use in the park and to establish a roster of eligible subsistence users in the Park/Preserve under section 1344 of ANILCA. Copies of the final dataset will reside at BLM, Ahtna, Copper River Native Assoc., and NPS. Some layers of this dataset have been extracted as separate records in the metadata database as they represent data that was automated as a result of this dataset compilation and are new electronic products.

The monthly sea ice grids are available on request\nvia ftp (see access instructions below), and may eventually be distributed \non CD-ROM with other SSM/I products.  The monthly sea ice grids can be used \nas a mask to block out ice-covered areas for various applications.  To \naccommodate as many  potential applications as possible, the monthly averaged \nice extent was delineated using four concentration values (0%, 5%, 10%, and \n15%) for the minimum concentrations included in the averages.  The grids are \n8-bit raster images containing 448 lines of 304 pixels (304x by 448y) for the\nnorthern hemisphere and 332 lines of 316 pixels (316x by 332y) for the\nsouthern.  IDL procedures were used to calculate monthly averages from the\ndaily-averaged SSM/I grids.  The data were then put into Hierarchical Data\nFormat (HDF).  Utilities to read and manipulate HDF data are available via\nftp from the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA).  The\nNCSA ftp server address is ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu; help is available from\nhelphdf@ncsa.uiuc.edu.",

            "description": "Data Type: Vegetation/Land Cover/Soils;  This data layer is a composite of vegetation and land cover data encompassing all of Prince William Sound and the Copper River drainage and eastern portions of the Kenai Peninsula. Original data sources include the Chugach National Forest Timber Type database, Interim Land Cover Program and Copper River Land Cover images from USGS EROS Alaska Field Office, and the Alaska Land and Resource Mapping System (ALARM) from the Alaska Department of Natural Resources (DNR). All of the original datasets were generalized; merged, and classified according to the Alaska Vegetation Classification, resulting in a generalized layer that broadly characterizes vegetation patterns throughout the area. Characteristics of the original data bases are outlined below; the data sets used to create this composite vegetation layer are documented separately The Chugach NF Timber Type database is a timber oriented vegetation layer based on interpretation of aerial photography. It is the most detailed digital vegetation information available for substantial areas within the greater Prince William Sound ecosystem. The database contains detailed information about timbered areas including species composition, stand density, stocking levels, stand class size, and volume. Many of these timber-oriented descriptions can be useful as surrogates for important ecological variables such as structural information about a given stand. The database also contains less detailed information on non- forest vegetation and cover types. Both the Interim Land Cover and Copper River Land Cover datasets are based on Landsat Multispectral Sensor (MSS) satellite imagery with an original resolution of 80 meters. The Copper River Land Cover data contains more detailed information on shrub and herbaceous communities than the Interim Land Cover Program and the Chugach NF Timber Type datasets. The ALARM datasets are based in part on interpretation of Landsat MSS imagery and aerial photography but have been generalized considerably; the minimum mapping unit used in the ALARM program was 640 acres. Each dataset used to compile this data layer uses a different vegetation classification scheme, a result of intended use and method of data automation. All but the Chugach National Forest Timber Type database use modifications of the Alaska Vegetation Classification scheme (Viereck et al. 1992). Pacific GIS developed a cross-walk from the vegetation types in each data source to the closest equivalent vegetation type in the Alaska Vegetation Classification scheme to provide a common classification that can be used across the ecosystem.",

Two CD-ROMs contain \nall F8 SSM/I ice concentrations, 9 July 1987 - 31 December 1991 (NP \nfiles = 137202 bytes, SP files = 105922 bytes, in HDF.  Software to read\nand manipulate HDF are available from National Center for Supercomputing\nApplications (NCSA) via ftp (ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu). Other public domain and \ncommercial software packages, such as IDL, are available that can read and \nmanipulate HDF.  SSM/I CD-ROMs are presently being distributed at no charge, \nwith first priority for the NASA and NASA-funded research communities.  \nThis distribution policy is subject to change without notice; please inquire.  \nNSIDC is processing DMSP F11 SSM/I in the same grid/projection.\n\nThe primary archive and distribution source for DMSP SSM/I swath\n(orbital) data (level 1b) is NOAA/NESDIS Satellite Data Services Division,\nPrinceton Executive Square, Room 100, Washington, DC 20233; telephone\n301-763-8402.",

The Chugach National Forest Timber Type database is a timber oriented vegetation layer based on interpretation of aerial photography. It is the most detailed digital vegetation information available for substantial areas within the greater Prince William Sound ecosystem. The database contains detailed information about timbered areas including species composition, stand density, stocking levels, stand class size, and volume. Many of these timber- oriented descriptions can be useful as surrogates for important ecological variables such as structural information about a given stand. The database also contains less detailed information on non-forest vegetation and cover types.",

Vegetative species information and related canopy cover data was collected from ground plots. Plots have been classified using the Alaska Vegetation Classification Scheme. All plots have been referenced on Alaska High Altitude Color Infrared photography at 1:63360 scale. The collection of this data was supported by the regional fire program to provide ground information as to fire fuels for Wrangell St. Elias National Park. These plots have been used for other applications as supportive information for landcover mapping, habitat interpretations, general vegetation knowledge, etc. A Vegetation Survey effort has been underway at the park for approximately 12 years and recently has expanded. Rare plant surveys are currently being conducted as well. All collection points are now spatially referenced with GPS systems.",

Sea\n     ice drifts to the right of the local wind, at angles ranging from 10 degree to 63\n     degree . The response to wind forcing is largest near the ice edge, both over\n     the middle portions of the shelf and along the southern margins of the seasonal\n     ice zone and during strong and steady wind of several days' duration. The\n     large wind-driven response of ice drift observed in this study, in comparison\n     with the Arctic, may result from (1) reduced levels of internal ice stress\n     associated with the generally thin ice cover and lower areal concentration of\n     sea ice, (2) large atmospheric drag coefficients associated with the small ice\n     floes in areas of comparatively higher ice concentration, and (3) smooth ice\n     bottom caused by melting. In nearshore areas the ice to wind coupling is\n     reduced owing to larger internal ice stresses experienced locally due to ice\n     pileup.",

Although a high degree of correlation exists between F8 and F11 \ndata (Abdalati et al. 1995), regression coefficients (NSIDC 1995) have been \napplied in deriving F11 daily ice concentrations, which form the basis for \nthis data set. Monthly averaged data files contain ice concentration in \npercent ranging from 0% to 100%. Then, ice concentrations are delineated \nusing 0%, 5%, 10% and 15% as the minimum concentrations included in the \naverages (e.g.: a 5% cutoff sets all data values between 1% and 5% to 0%). \nThese four thresholds accommodate as many potential applications as possible. \nGrids are 8-bit raster images stored in HDF.

Data are stored in\nHDF and packaged in compressed tar format. These ice concentrations\ncontinue the series begun with DMSP-F8 SSM/I coverage, generated using the\nNASA Team algorithm. Processing is continuous on the F11 data, beginning 3\nDecember 1991.  The DMSP-F8 and -F11 data demonstrate a high degree of\ncorrelation (Abdalati et al. 1995) although regression coefficients are\napplied in the development of F11 ice concentrations in order to maintain\nconsistency of the data set (NSIDC 1995). Data are available via ftp\n(sidads.colorado.edu, IP address 128.138.135.20).",

Associated ASCII files linked to the INFO attribute file contains legal boundary descriptions for each quadrangle. Data is limited to use at a 1:250,000 scale or smaller and is intended for use at a regional or statewide scale for general planning purposes. Site specific evaluation of CZM boundaries should consult more detailed CZM District data sets existing in manual and some in automated form. The Habitat and Restoration Division of The Alaska Department of Fish and Game has a working copy of this data set that is utilized for the coastal zone permitting process.",

Grids represent spatially interpolated data. The interpolation technique maximizes the radiometric integrity of original brightness temperature values, maintain high spatial and temporal precision, and involve no averaging of original swath data. \n\nCoverage is global and spans the Pathfinder SSM/I Benchmark period, from\n1 August 1987 through 30 November 1988.  Resolution is 25 km for all channels \nand 12.5 km for the 85 GHz channels. There are 18 brightness temperature files \nper day for a given projection (nine each for ascending and descending passes), \nand two (ascending and descending) corresponding time files. Data are contained\nin flat binary files, either one image per file consisting of two-dimensional 2-byte integer arrays of brightness temperatures in tenths of Kelvins, or in the case of time files, two-dimensional 1-byte integer arrays consisting of GMT in tenths of hours. \n\nData are available as processing is completed, with completion of the data set projected for the end of 1995. Data are available via ftp, on CD-ROM and through the Internet.  Contact NSIDC User Services for information.",

Activity on state land is recorded, by section, in DNR's Land Administration System (LAS). Note that this is not a parcel database. If parts of a single section fall into different ownership categories, then that section will contain multiple codes (see list below). Thus, a section may appear to have conflicting land status due to the resolution of the data (section on/section off), while at the parcel level, there would be no conflicting land status. Detailed maps by township (state status plats) portraying state land ownership are available at the Public Information Center, Department of Natural Resources. Similar maps (master title plats) portraying federal and native land ownership are available at the BLM Public Room, Bureau of Land Management. Please consult these maps for a more precise location of land ownership, and consult the public land record for current land status information.",

To date nearly 15,000 sites have been recorded within Alaska (however, this is probably only a small percentage of the sites which may actually exist but are as yet unreported.) The fundamental use of the AHRS is to protect cultural resource sites from unwanted destruction.

The spacing between elevation along profiles is 2 arc seconds of latitude by 3 arc seconds of longitude. Each profile has 451 elevations. DEM data for 15-minute units correspond to the USGS 15-minute topographic quadrangle map series in Alaska. The unit sizes in Alaska vary depending on the latitude. Unit south of 59 degrees North cover 15x20-minute areas, those between 59 and 62 degrees North cover 15x22.5-minute areas.",

The hypsography used for statewide map products is often depicted as a contour line at every 3,000 feet, which offers visualization of vertical control as it relates to other map features.

AVHRR is a broad-band, 4 or 5 channel (depending on the model) scanner, sensing in the visible, near-infrared and thermal  infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The average full-resolution instantaneous field-of-view of 1.4 milliradians yields a ground resolution of approximately 1.1 km at the satellite nadir from the nominal orbit altitude of 833 km. Each scan of 2048 pixels generates a raster over 2400 km (1500 miles) across, and the scanning rate is 360 scans per minute. There are approximately 25,000 images of the state of Alaska and adjacent waters in the AVHRR archive at the University of Alaska Fairbanks Geodata Center. Data in the archive dates back to 1974 from the polar orbiting satellites NOAA 2 - 12. Each image has a resolution of 1.1 km. From 1974 to January 1988, most of the imagery  is photographic (transparency) format. Both infrared and visible band data are available. Because of an internal need for near-real-time (daily) satellite imagery, the GeoData Center archived 8-bit digital  field data from the Gilmore Tracking Station on 8-mm high density tapes from 1989 through 1991. There are over 1000 digital images available in this collection (bands 1, 2, and 4). The GeoData center has hard-copy photos from 1974 to 1988, archived data from 1988 to the present is in the form of a facsimile copy. The EROS Data Center (EDC) implemented an AVHRR Data Acquisition and Processing System (ADAPS), in May 1987. Under a current agreement between NOAA and the U.S. Geological Survey, Federal agencies may acquire ADAPS geo-registered and other derivative/enhanced AVHRR data from the EROS Data Center. AVHRR Level 1b data are available from NOAA.",

The goal of the Alaska AVHRR project is to compile a comprehensive time series data set of calibrated, georegistered daily observations and twice monthly maximum NDVI composites for each annual growing season. This data set has applications for environmental monitoring and assessing impacts of global climate change. The NDVI composites include ten bands of information: AVHRR channels 1-5, maximum NDVI, satellite zenith, solar zenith, and relative azimuth. The daily observations, bands 1-9, have been calibrated to reflectance, scaled to byte data, and geometrically registered to the Albers Equal-Area Conic map projection. The tenth band is a pointer to identify the date and scene ID of the source daily observation (scene) for each pixel. All image processing was conducted using the Land Analysis System (LAS) software. Often when displaying data covering large areas, such as AVHRR data, it is beneficial to include an overlay of familiar linework as a location aid, or a mask to derive statistical data for regions. All of the line work images represent lines in raster format as 1 km cells and the strata are represented as polygons registered to the AVHRR data. The line work and raster polygon data sets include are the international boundaries, Alaskan roads and Trans-Alaska Pipeline, and a raster polygon mask of the State borders. The EROS Data Center standard product is a set of multiple CD-ROM.",

            "description": "Data Type: Remotely Sensed Data;   A MSS sensor has flown on all five of the Landsats. The first satellite in the Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS) program was launched July 23, 1972. A second satellite followed on January 22, 1975. At that time the program was redesignated as the Landsat program to emphasize its primary area of interest, land resources. The mission of Landsat is to provide for repetitive acquisition of high resolution multispectral data of the earth's surface on a global basis. Landsat data is available from the U.S. EROS Data 7/16/82 with Landsat 5 following on 3/1/84. Paths 57-68 and Rows 17-20 cover Prince William Sound Copper River Region and Glacier Bay Ecosystem Initiative  Areas. MSS data is collected at low resolution, about 80x60 meters on the ground. Intended use by private commercial organizations, public agencies, and governmental organizations around the world for urban and regional planning, environmental monitoring, conservation, mineral exploration, and many other applications. Landsat 1 was launched 7/23/72 and deactivated 1/6/78; 2 was launched 1/22/75 and deactivated 2/25/82; 3 was launched 3/5/78 and deactivated 3/31/83; 4 was launched 7/16/82 and 5 on 3/1/84. Both Landsat 4 and 5 are still active and carry both MSS and Thematic Mapper. MSS sensor responds to earth reflected sunlight in four spectral bands. There is an additional thermal infrared band, band 8. MSS data available through USGS, EROS data center and Geodata Center, University of Alaska Fairbanks Geophysical Institute, which has 14,000 MSS images.",

Data within the station mask of ASF, approximated by a 3000 km radius circle centered on Fairbanks has been acquired since September 1991 for ERS and May 1992 for JERS. Approval by NASA or ESA is required to obtain the data. Please contact ASF user services to become a NASA approved investigator. A variety of products are available on a variety of photographic and digital media. Available products include: *Full-res images are 4-look SAR images with 30 m resolution and 12.5 m pixel spacing over a 100 km x 100 km area. These are 8192 pixel 8192 pixel by 8 bit (64MB) images. The data is corrected to the GEM06 geoid model. *Low-res images are produced 8x8 averaging the full-res data. The resulting image is 1024x1024 pixels x8 bits (1 MB). *Geocoded images are produced from either a full-res or lo-res image upon request. Geocoded  images have been processed so they align with the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) or Polar-Stereographic (PS) map projections. Projection attributes and the center latitude and longitude used for processing can be set by the user. *Complex images, created on request, are 1-look data with approximately 10 resolution covering an area of 30x50 km. Data is formatted as 12,888 pixel x 2048 pixel x 32 bit complex integer (16I, 16Q-~100MB). The data contains backscatter amplitude and phase useful for interferometry studies of topography and feature motion. *Computer compatible signal data is spacecraft signal data represented as complex integers in byte aligned 8 bit bytes. Only 5 bits of each byte is significant. Each file is ~160 MB. The user must perform their own signal correlation.",

Both satellite's TM radiometers acquire day and night data which are systematically corrected during processing. The standard digital data product is in a band sequential (BSQ) FAST format. Landsat 4 and 5's TM mechanical scanning radiometers operate in 7 channels of the electromagnetic spectrum (band 1 spectral range is .45-.52 micometers, band 2 is .52-.60, band 3 is .63-.69, band 4 is .76-.90, band 5 is 1.55-1.75, band 6 is 10.40-12.50, and band 7 is 2.08-2.35). Six reflective bands are blue, green, red, and near infrared. Two shortwave infrared bands and a band measuring emitted energy 10.4 to 12.5 micrometers and has 120 meter ground resolution. Landsat 4 was launched 7/16/82 with Landsat 5 following on 3/1/84. Paths 57-68 and Rows 17-20 cover Prince William Sound Copper River Region and Glacier Bay Ecosystem Initiative Areas.",

Terrain is portrayed by contour lines and features such as roads, towns, water areas, and vegetation are shown by map symbols and colors. Dates of maps vary, as most maps were first produced using aerial photos from the 1940's and 50's, but many maps have been revised to 1980's using aerial photos from the 1970's and 1980's. Contours are at 100 foot intervals. Available as hard-copy paper or mylar maps. It is possible to order a separate, full-scale film negative or positive that shows in black and white all the features printed in a given color on a particular map.",

            "description": "Seabird Colony Catalog database is an ongoing synthesis of seabird field survey data geographically separated into eleven regions, region four covers the Gulf of Alaska. This system is primarily a database management system with the ability to portray spatial data to a map. The database has three major data components, species information, colony information and life history information. Some 45 species in 2600 colonies are archived in this database. Species numbers, date, and other information on census method, observer, data quality codes, footnotes, historical data and best estimates, are included for each seabird colony. The database is updated to reflect ongoing field surveys from a variety of contributors and USFWS. Output from the system can be in the form of textual query results, ascii flat files and eventually maps. Database was initially developed using CMAS (Computer Mapping and Analysis System) and ATLAS MAPMAKER on a MacIntosh computer, and has since been ported by USFWS to PC Paradox database format. Output from this database is exported to Atlas GIS for map generation. The intended use of this database is to provide information to the state decision making process for development in the coastal zone and for emergency response, and regional scale analysis of distribution patterns for biogeographic investigation.",

Transects were recorded from the bridge of a 58 foot Seine Vessel while traveling between and during salmon and herring fisheries: Alexander Archipelago, Prince William Sound, Kenai Peninsula, Alaska Peninsula, and Bristol Bay. The majority of transects are near shore regions of the Gulf of Alaska. Absolute counts, behavior, flyways, fishholding, fledged young, and molt data are recorded throughout surveys. Additional relative distribution records were recorded for all bird species and migratory counts. The most extensive records are from northern Southeast Alaska. Latitude and Longitudes were recorded on NOAA National Ocean Service Charts.",

A variety of systems such as ARC/INFO and CAMRIS (Computer Aided Mapping and Resources Inventory System) and various database systems have been used to store and analyze this data over time. As of 1994, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game has launched an effort to begin using ARC/INFO to analyze the distribution and abundance data to evaluate sea lion critical habitats. This data is the GIS application of the same data set in National Marine Fisheries, Marine Fisheries Lab, metadata record #070.",

These layers are being produced using the same protocols as that being used by Dr. David Eslinger and his students at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) to process daily sea surface temperature under another project.

The OCC Program chartered the fishing vessel Northwest Explorer to conduct the U.S. BASIS survey, and sent scientists onboard the Japanese BASIS vessel Kaiyo Maru and the Russian BASIS vessel TINRO.  Stock identification data were collected aboard all three vessels to assist in the construction of migratory models of salmon stocks.  Stomach and muscle tissue samples were collected for diet and lipid studies, and scales and otoliths were collected for age and detailed growth studies.  Seventeen immature chum salmon were tagged from the Kaiyo Maru and released with temperature and depth recording tags.",

Adult chinook salmon were captured in the lower river near the villages of Marshall and Russian Mission and tagged with radio transmitters.  Fish moving upriver were recorded by remote tracking stations located throughout the basin on important travel corridors and spawning tributaries.  Aerial tracking surveys were also flown to obtain detailed movement and distribution information in spawning areas.  An automated database and geographic information system (GIS) mapping program was used to summarize telemetry data in season to provide resource managers with updated information.  Work on an Internet link to the database was also completed and used during 2002.",

Fixed acoustic receivers located along corridors leading from the rearing locations to the open ocean will be used to monitor the timing of juvenile emigration from their nearshore rearing habitat to the more open waters of the Gulf of Alaska. T utilize archival electronic tags in addition to sonic tags to provide information on juvenile sablefish movement and habitat use during their transition from nearshore rearing areas to offshore areas where they are intercepted by the fishery.  Archival tags will be used to record the temperature and depth experienced by juvenile sablefish from the time they leave the nearshore rearing areas at age 1+ or greater until the time they recruit to the fishery at age 2+ or greater.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: Unknown\n\nAccess constraints: None\n\nUse constraints: Contact the agency.\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.

Pot limits are viewed as one potential way of\n     reducing management problems. Two pot limit schemes were considered here:\n     fixed pot limits, where each vessel is limited to the same number of pots, and\n     proportional reduction requirements, where each vessel must reduce its\n     number of pots (determined by past registration) by the same percentage.\n     Production functions relating vessel performance to pot numbers were\n     estimated. These models were subsequently employed in model simulations to\n     evaluate potential effects various pot limit regulations may have on fleet\n     performance. Results of this study suggest that the 1992 decision of the\n     Alaska Board of Fisheries to implement a fixed limit of 250 pots per vessel in\n     the Bristol Bay red king crab fishery (a decision that since has been revoked)\n     may have conflicted with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and\n     Management Act and the North Pacific Fishery Management Council's plan\n     for the Bering Sea-Aleutian Islands king crab fisheries. Additionally, the\n     enacted pot limit may not have achieved desired management objectives.",

Disturbance to epifauna, likely from fishing activities was observed at most dive sites and appeared to be more evident in heavily fished areas.  Coral coverage on the substrate ranged from approximately 5% on low-relief pebble substrate to 100% coverage on high-relief bedrock outcrops.  Unique coral habitat consisting of high density gardens of corals, sponges, and other sessile invertebrates was found at five sites between 150 and 350 m depth.  These gardens were similar in structural complexity to tropical coral reefs and shared several important characteristics with tropical reefs, including complex vertical relief and high taxonomic diversity.",

This  mapping effort is complementary to similar mapping that was done last year in the vicinity of Cape Ommaney in Southeast Alaska and on Portlock Bank northeast of Kodiak.",

This project was initiated in 1997 to study the habitat use and early marine ecology of juvenile (age -.0) Pacific salmon.  The SECM research addresses components identified in the NMFS Strategic Plan and the NPAFC 2001-2005 Science Plan.  The goal of the SECM research is to build a time series of data to examine how biophysical parameters affect regional stocks of salmon with respect to habitat use, marine growth, and hatchery-wild stock interactions, and to understand these relationships in conjunction with environmental change, year-class strength of salmon, and coastal marine carrying capacity of salmon.\n\nStatus: In Progress\n\nMaintenance frequency: Unknown\n\nAccess constraints: None\n\nUse constraints: Contact the agency.\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.

The model grid is configured on a rotated spherical coordinate system and its resolution is 1/6\u00b0 (~18 km) with 30 levels. The model domain extends from Bering Strait through the Central Arctic, Nordic and Barents Seas into the sub-polar North Atlantic (to ~45\u00b0N) and it includes the Canadian Archipelago. Daily-averaged operational atmospheric fields from the European Centre for Medium-range Weather (ECMWF) for 1994-98 are used to force the model in addition to the 1979-93 reanalyzed data. It is important to note that the only interannual forcing in the model comes from the prescribed atmospheric fields. The model has been integrated initially for 200 years forced with 1990-94 atmospheric fields. It was then spun up for 20 years using the repeated 1979 annual cycle, which was followed by an additional 2-decade integration using 1979-1998 atmospheric data.\nThe new 9-km coupled ice-ocean model, developed at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) in Monterey, California, USA, is configured on a 1/12\u00b0 and 45-level rotated spherical grid.  It consists of a regional adaptation of the POP, developed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, coupled to a parallel version of the original Hibler dynamic-thermodynamic model with a viscous-plastic rheology.  The model uses ECMWF daily-averaged reanalyzed data for 1979-1993 and 1994-2002 operational products, including the surface incoming long wave and shortwave radiation, 2-m air temperature and dew point temperature, and 10-m winds.  The model incorporates a 2.5-km bathymetry field, developed by the International Bathymetry Charting of the Arctic Ocean project, interpolated to the 9-km grid.  The model domain extends from the\nPacific Ocean (~30\u00b0N) through the Central Arctic, Nordic and Barents Seas into the North Atlantic (to ~40\u00b0N) and it allows realistic exchanges through Bering Strait.  Results from the ongoing model integration are just becoming available.",

A composite current pattern is derived using these data. The two principal currents (the Alaskan Stream and Kamchatka Current) are clearly evident. Eddy kinetic-mean kinetic energy ratios are low in the Stream and along the western Bering Sea basin. An eastward flowing current occurred along the north flank of the Aleutian Islands; this flow was modified by inflow at the passes. Westward flow occurred north of 56\u00b0N; its source was the Bering Slope Current. The Kamchatka Current originated near 175\u00b0E along the Russian coast. Numerous eddies and meanders were observed in the Kamchatka Current; eddies were also present on the eastern side of the basin.\n\nhttp://www.pmel.noaa.gov/pubs/publications.shtml",

All moorings had current meters between 200 m and 500 m above the bottom, and some extended to within 150 m of the surface. There  were high vertical correlations between measurements on the same mooring within 1500 m of the bottom and within 800 m of the surface  but almost no significant correlation in the horizontal. In the basin the presence of eddies appears strongest at depths below 1200 m.  Several of the records exceed 3 years in length, and one extended for 5 years. Spectral analysis of these shows that most of the kinetic\nenergy below 3000 m is in the temporal mesoscale (periods of 31 to 120 days), while the spectral estimates in the upper 1000 m are  dominated by longer time scales. Only in the deep records is there a significant southward mean flow. Neither a mean California Current nor a poleward undercurrent is apparent in the shallower data (above 1250 m). The currents in the upper 500 m nearest the continental margin are influenced by the presence of cold filaments originating near Point Arena.",

There were distinct differences in the atmospheric forcing between the 2 yr, which produced accompanying differences in the currents. During 1978, larvae were more likely to be transported onto the shallow shelves adjacent to the sea valley, while during 1990 they were more likely to remain in the sea valley. The relevance of these results to the effects of future climate trends on the Alaska\nCoastal Current and larval survival are discussed.",

            "description": "Current moorings were deployed on the continental shelf at 13 locations in the northwest Gulf of Alaska. They measured the Alaska Coastal Current at three positions along the coast during April-October 1991. The strongest currents were in the confined region of Shelikof Strait. Mean daily transport was as large as 2.5 \uffd7 10 m s. Mean transport over the 6-month period ranged from 0.85 \uffd7 10 ms at the easternmost line (off Gore Point) to 0.64 \uffd7 10 m s at the westernmost section (Shelikof Strait), indicating significant transport to the south of Kodiak Island. The transports were well correlated (r > 0.8) and in phase with each other and were also correlated with wind (r ~ 0.6). Data suggest that in Shelikof Strait and off Gore Point, baroclinic flow is ~75% and <40%, respectively, of total transport.",

The model reproduced many of the dominant circulation features, including the cross-sectional spatial structure of the Alaskan Coastal Current, the estuarine inflow at the bottom of the sea valley, and the mean transport. The first-mode empirical orthogonal functions of the model and of the observed data represent similar spatial structures and were significantly correlated in time. While the model produced eddies (>20-km diameter) at a similar rate as observed, the timing did not generally match the observations. As a result, correlations between the measured currents and model-generated currents usually were not significant. Correlations between modeled and measured transport through the sea valley, however, were significant for both years.",

Lloyd's index of patchiness ranged from 3.9-6.1 for eggs and 3.9-16.2 for larvae. This index was size (age) dependent: low for eggs, high for newly hatched larvae, then decreasing through late larval stage. By the early juvenile stage, patchiness increased as pollock began to school. The percent of larvae in a patch (defined as the percent of larvae present at stations where larval counts exceeded the mean by one standard deviation during the given survey) varied greatly (26-92%). Larval distributions were used to deduce physical mechanisms responsible for patches. Three categories of patches were identified: those created by interaction of larvae with time-dependent currents, those in the vicinity of Sutwik Island, and those associated with eddies. Simulation experiments were utilized to examine processes influencing patch formation and the role of larval swimming. Between 5 and 6 weeks after hatching, larvae have swimming abilities that enable them to maintain a patch already created by physical mechanisms.",

Meanders or eddies were evident in the trajectories as the drifters were advected onto the shelf. An anticyclonic eddy formed at the shoreward termination of on-shelf flow (120 m isobath). The eddy dissipated in 8-10 days. Such events can be important mechanisms in replenishing nutrients and introducing oceanic plankton and larvae onto the shelf.",

Heat and moisture transfers at the surface and through the top of the boundary layer are evaluated for three cases with warm, southerly flow ahead of cold fronts and two cases of cooler, westerly and northern flow behind fronts. The prefrontal boundary layers are nearly neutrally stratified and surface heat and moisture fluxes are small. Surface fluxes tend to be downward just ahead of the fronts and are of greater magnitude during stronger storms. Entrainment fluxes at the top of the prefrontal boundary layers are generally larger than surface fluxes and are the dominant sources of heating for the boundary layers. Entrainment rates determined from budgets compare well with laboratory studies of shear-driven entrainment. In the postfrontal cases, surface heat and moisture fluxes are the dominant sources of total heating within the boundary layers. Entrainment velocities are larger in postfrontal than prefrontal regions, but entrainment has only a small and positive net effect on the total heat content. In postfrontal transition layers the Richardson numbers are large, and entrainment is forced by turbulence generated by buoyancy in the surface layers and radiative and evaporative cooling from the tops of stratocumulus clouds. Cumulus-scale penetrative convection represents the major sink of boundary layer moisture for one case with a long atmospheric fetch over the ocean.",

Synoptic-scale and mesoscale analyses were constructed using NOAA P-3 aircraft flight-level and radar data and dropwindsonde profiles, in addition to conventional data sources. The synoptic-scale analyses show that polar low development occurred in a low-level mesoscale baroclinic zone near the center of a mature, occluded synoptic-scale low pressure system. The disturbances propagated along the zone in the reverse shear sense, i.e., in the direction opposite to the thermal wind within the zone. The mesoscale analysis reveals a boundary layer jet of 38 m son the cold side of the baroclinic zone accompanying the leading polar low. Indirect evidence suggests that a Sawyer-Eliassen secondary circulation was present; polar low development occurred in the region of a frontogenetical geostrophic deformation. Convective activity was not prominent during the growth phase of the polar lows, as determined from satellite imagery and radar reflectivity measurements. Extremely high ocean waves (~13 m) occurred in response to intense wind forcing on the mesoscale on a sea state preconditioned by moderate forcing on the synoptic scale. The observed synoptic-scale and mesoscale structures are compared with results from previously studied polar lows. This case appears to represent an example of polar low development due primarily to moist baroclinic processes.",

            "description": "Atmospheric soundings were collected from a research ship in the eastern equatorial Pacific to determine the kinematic and thermodynamic structure of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) in the vicinity of a strong front in sea surface temperature (SST). These observations have been used to test the hypothesis proposed by Wallace et al. and Hayes et al. that the low-level wind shear was enhanced on the cold side of the front because of greater static stability. The PBL structure was analyzed from a transect along 110\u00b0W from 10\u00b0N to 5\u00b0S, with a focus on the ~500-m-deep atmospheric mixed layer, as defined with respect to virtual potential temperature (). Significant mixed-layer variability was found due to diurnal and other effects, but there were systematic differences in mean structure as a function of latitude. The mixed layer was neutrally stratified over warm water between 6.5\u00b0N and 1.5\u00b0N and was slightly stably stratified over the cooler water between 1\u00b0N and 2\u00b0S. The mean total vertical wind shear within the mixed layer (mostly in the form of speed shear) was ~2 \uffd7 10 s over the warm water and ~8 \uffd7 10 s over the cooler water. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis proposed by Wallace et al. and Hayes et al. and can account for the weakness in the southerly winds at the surface on the cool side of the oceanic frontal zone.",

Synoptic and mesoscale analyses compare the structure of an upper-level jet-front system observed slightly downstream from the wind speed maximum (exit region) to its structure in the upstream entrance region. Stratospheric potential vorticity and ozone were found within the frontal zone down to ~800 mb. Microscale analyses of the front near the sea surface were carried out for a portion of the front having the signature of a \"rope\" cloud (shallow cumulus line) in satellite imagery. A narrow (<1 km) zone of upward motion (~4 ms) and of horizontal shear (~10 s) characterized the front near the surface. Significant alongfront variability was found, including lateral displacements in the frontal zone where there were weaker updrafts; similar structures have been previously observed along precipitating fronts using Doppler radar. Pressure perturbations measured directly by the aircraft resemble pressure perturbations for a deeper, precipitating front that were derived indirectly from Doppler radar data. Results show that the frontal zone was well defined through the depth of the troposphere, tapering from a width of ~100 km in the upper troposphere to ~1 km at the surface. The collapse of the front to such a narrow scale within the boundary layer occurred in the absence of precipitation, and obviously, in the absence of topographical influences.",

The terrain in this region includes a low sill at Wide Bay (approximately 300 m high and 80 km wide), which is flanked by moderate terrain to the southwest (~900 m high) and higher terrain to the northeast (~1500 m high). For the case of 26 February 1987, a large Froude number (Fr ~ 1.6) characterized the incident flow. Boundary-layer wind speeds were approximately 30 m s downstream of the gap at Wide Bay and the moderate terrain. The cross-terrain component of the wind above the boundary layer was 24 m s upstream of the barrier and as large as 45 m s approximately 70 km downstream of the barrier. Wind speeds were significantly less above and downstream of this wind maximum, as with a hydraulic jump. A prominent trough in sea-level pressure was observed in the lee of the higher terrain; the largest 100-m wind speeds (~34 m s) observed were near this trough. For the case of 3 March 1987, the incident flow over the Alaska Peninsula was weak, and the Froude number was small (Fr ~ 0.4). In this situation, a low-level outflow (~300 m high) with large wind speeds, cold air temperatures, and high sea-level pressure was isolated to the region downstream from the gap at Wide Bay.",

            "description": "In this paper, the distributions of nine dominant marine mammal species of the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort Seas region have been subjected to principal components analysis. The six species assemblages that resulted from this analysis imply some degree\nof habitat partitioning. The distribution patterns of these assemblages appear to correlate with sea-ice conditions. For example, a northern Bering Sea assemblage is strongly correlated with broken pack. Also, some areas lack strong association with any\nassemblage, notably Shpanberg Strait, east of St. Lawrence Island. However, the associations identified and presented are hypothetical, and are in need of further testing. Factors other than sea ice must be taken into account in explaining assemblage\ndistributions and interactions between species and the environment. \n\nNOAAServer Codes: [OL 72 55 -130 -168] ; nodateline obtain",

The focus is on the turbulent heat fluxes at the base of the mixed layer, which are calculated as a residual in the mean diurnal heat budget. The inferred downward heat flux at the base of the mixed layer is ~150 W m, averaged over the mean diurnal cycle, and ranged from near zero in the morning and early afternoon to ~200 W m during the late afternoon until dawn. The magnitude and phasing of the mean diurnal cycle were similar for different definitions of the mixed layer depth. The inferred residual turbulent fluxes were used also to estimate the mean diurnal cycles in vertical eddy diffusivity and turbulent dissipation rate. These turbulence parameters and the heat fluxes from which they were derived have magnitudes that are broadly consistent with those estimated previously from direct microstructure measurements.",

            "description": "The northerly winds that predominate along the U.S. west coast during April-September are interrupted periodically by abrupt reversals to southerly flow. The climatology and composite temporal evolution of these reversals from Point Conception to the Canadian border are documented using hourly data from moored coastal buoys and Coastal-Marine Automated Network stations for the period 1981-91. The reversals are divided into two categories: coastally trapped reversals, in which the southerly flow is highly ageostrophic and restricted to the coastal zone, and synoptic reversals, which are associated with landfalling troughs or fronts. Coastally trapped events occur on average about 1.5 times per month along the central and northern California coast, about twice a month near the California-Oregon border, and about once a month near the Oregon-Washington border. The ratio of coastally trapped reversals to synoptic reversals is higher during July-September and lower during April-June, particularly in the north. Roughly one-quarter of the coastally trapped reversals have a southerly wind component that exceeds 5 m s. Reversals along the California coast are gradual; the changes in the alongshore winds usually occur over a period of 6 h or longer, and the maximum southerlies are less than 8 m s. In contrast, roughly one-half of the reversals north of the California-Oregon border feature abrupt changes with southerly winds reaching ~10-12 m s within 2-3 h of the wind shifts. These stronger northern events often include substantial decreases in air temperature and rises in pressure. The southerlies associated with coastally trapped reversals persist for an average of about 30 h at a particular location. There is a strong tendency for coastally trapped reversals to occur during the night or morning. North of Monterey Bay, the reversals typically advance poleward (but not necessarily in a smoothly continuous manner) at a mean speed of 7-8 m s and maintain significant amplitude for an alongshore distance of 500-1000 km.",

Its objectives include better understanding and forecasting of landfalling weather systems and, in particular, the modification and creation of mesoscale structures by coastal orography. In addition, COAST has placed considerable emphasis on the evaluation of mesoscale models in coastal terrain. These goals have been addressed through case studies of storm and frontal landfall along the Pacific Northwest coast using special field observations from a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration WP-3D research aircraft and simulations from high-resolution numerical models. The field work was conducted during December 1993 and December 1995. Active weather conditions encompassing a variety of synoptic situations were sampled. This article presents an overview of the program as well as highlights from a sample of completed and ongoing case studies.",

We have examined how these events are associated with large scale central North Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, using an index for the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The anomalies in turbulent air-sea heat fluxes and low-level baroclinity associated with the PDO are manifested differently during troughs than during ridges in their effects on the transient eddies (storms). These effects may help explain why prominent troughs (ridges) occur about 3 (2.5) times more frequently during periods when the PDO is significantly positive (negative) than of opposite sign. Our results suggest that the state of the mid-latitude Pacific Ocean more fundamentally affects the atmosphere than has been thought.",

            "description": "METLIB-II is a FORTRAN program library for deriving time series of geostrophic, gradient, or surface winds from sea level pressure (SLP) and ancillary fields gridded on a polar stereographic projection. Such fields are generated at the National Meteorological Center (NMC) and at Fleet Numerical Oceanography Center (FNOC); they can also be generated by digitizing SLP charts analyzed manually. The library also contains programs for contouring scalars, such as SLP, air temperature, or wind speed, and for plotting wind vectors on a map background. Plotting is based upon the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) graphics routines. A major advantage of the library is that spherical geometric calculations involving polar stereographic grids are internal to the programs. The relationship between geostrophic or gradient wind and surface wind can be assigned from speed reduction and turning angle constants or by a baroclinic, stability-dependent, single point boundary layer model. METLIB-II differs from METLIB in that the software was revised to increase efficiency of calculation. Internally, names of programs, functions, and subroutines were changed to give a clear indication of their purpose; documentation was revised and increased to give the user an exact explanation of each step in the software. The user is able to specify more input conditions and request more output variables, such as heat flux, vapor flux, momentum flux, etc. Some boundary layer solution subroutines were extensively modified.",

            "description": "Hourly measurements of wind speed and wind direction from Cherni Island, Thin Point, Cold Bay, and Ugaiushak Island during the latter half of 1984 and the first half of 1985 show evidence of orographic steering of winds in the coastal zone. Surface wind directions at Cherni Island, Thin Point, and Cold Bay often were attributable--30% of the time at Cherni Island and Thin Point, 50% of the time at Cold Bay--to channeling of the wind by a gap in the Aleutian Range. At Ugaiushak Island 30% of surface winds came from the WNW. It is likely that these winds followed a convoluted path through the mountains from the Meshik River valley to the southwest. Representations of topographically undisturbed surface winds for the same four locations over the period June 1984 through May 1985 were produced by turning and reducing gradient winds computed from digitized, 6-hourly, sea-level-pressure analyses obtained from the U.S. Navy's Fleet Numerical Oceanography Center. These wind estimates show a more evenly distributed wind direction population, with a slight tendency for winds to dominate from the NW and SE. Monthly correlation coefficients between measured and estimated u and v wind components ranged from 0.48 to 0.94. Because of anomalous winter and spring weather conditions, measured Cold Bay wind statistics for some months of the study do not compare favorably with climate averages. Yearly averages compare more favorably, and these statistics may be representative of normal conditions.",

            "description": "The thermal contrast between cold air over continental Alaska and relatively warm marine air over the Gulf of Alaska causes frequent, low-level, offshore-directed winds over the south-central Alaskan coast during the cold season. Coastal mountains affect these winds by inhibiting low-level mixing of continental and marine air masses near the coast, by providing channels that focus and accelerate drainage winds, and by exciting mountain-lee waves. Offshore-directed winds were observed twice with a research aircraft. The strongest winds were measured at the mouth of the Copper River and over and downwind of Resurrection Bay. The synoptic weather pattern and its orientation to local topographic features influenced wind magnitude. With the pressure gradient perpendicular to the coast, offshore-directed flow was light except at the Copper River and Resurrection Bay drainages. When the pressure gradient was aligned with the shore, regional surface winds were stronger and more uniform, although the Copper River and Resurrection Bay drainages were still discernible. Evaluation of local force balances showed the largest ageostrophy at coastal locations downwind of bays and river valleys. Seaward from the coast, ageostrophic accelerations and cross-isobaric wind components were smaller, indicating a transition toward geotriptic equilibrium. This spatial adjustment pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that equilibrium is achieved within a distance similar to the regional Rossby radius of deformation.",

            "description": "During February 1982 a NOAA research aircraft investigated a cold, low-level jet blowing from a gap between mountain ranges on the west side of Cook Inlet, Alaska. The jet blew 200 km southeastward across Cook Inlet between the Kenai Peninsula and the Kodiak archipelago, passing into the Gulf of Alaska where it merged with the large-scale marine wind field. Measurement commenced 35 km downstream of the seaward end of the gap. The jet's internal boundary layer accelerated by 5% and grew 20% in depth for 50 km;  thereafter, wind speed and boundary-layer depth were nearly constant for the next 100 km. The strongest winds (>20 m sat a height of 80 m) were observed on the south side of the jet's thermal axis and 90 km downstream from the coast. Budget analyses reveal that the down-gradient acceleration within the jet was principally opposed by surface friction, and the cold air advection was balanced by a strong upward-directed sensible heat flux from Cook Inlet and entrainment of warmer air from aloft.",

Proxy winds were computed for the same five locations from digitized sea level pressure fields using a simple geotriptic wind model. Shoreward of the Rossby deformation radius, the friction parameters of the geotriptic model vary from their open-ocean values, slowing the winds and rotating them farther counterclockwise. These changing friction parameters account for the effect of the mountains on the surface wind distribution. Proxy winds and observed surface winds are coherent for periods longer than about 2 days and are better correlated farther seaward from the coast and for northeasterly alongshore winds and southeasterly onshore winds. Estimates of numbers of storms, regional wind\nstress, and regional vorticity determined from proxy winds are qualitatively accurate.",

            "description": "This report assesses the status of the coastal Pacific whiting\n                        (Merluccius productus) resource in 1993. It reviews recent\n                        developments in the Pacific whiting fishery, tabulates and analyzes\n                        the 1992 catch statistics, reports on the 1992 triennial\n                        acoustic/midwater trawl and bottom trawl surveys of Pacific\n                        whiting, describes a stock synthesis model application using catch\n                        and survey data from 1965 to 1992, and presents yield options for\n                        1994-96. The U.S. and Canadian harvest of Pacific whiting in\n                        1992 was 295,189 metric tons (t). In 1993, the yield is expected\n                        to be 203,000 t. Assessment surveys conducted during summer of\n                        1992 by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and the\n                        Canada Department of Fisheries and Oceans resulted in estimates\n                        of population abundance considerably in excess of forecasts based\n                        on earlier surveys and models. Population biomass was estimated\n                        by the coastwide NMFS acoustic survey as 2.557 million t, more\n                        than double the acoustic estimate of 1.264 million t in 1989. The\n                        1992 acoustic survey was conducted with a new echo-integration\n                        system and had a wider areal coverage than previous assessments.\n                        However, the population biomass estimates made with the new\n                        system still depend on the acoustic target strength of Pacific\n                        whiting, which continues to have a large amount of uncertainty\n                        associated with it. A geographic version of the stock synthesis\n                        model that divided the population into U.S. and Canadian\n                        components was used to assess the Pacific whiting population.\n                        Population biomass peaked in 1987 and has been declining\n                        steadily since that time. The biomass of age 3 and older fish in\n                        1992 was estimated to be 3,055 million t. The recruitment\n                        abundance of the 1989 and 1990 year classes were estimated at\n                        0.233 and 1.999 billion fish respectively, indicating that the 1989\n                        year class is a weak year class, while the 1990 year class is close\n                        to the average 1977-92 recruitment of 2.170 billion age-2 fish.\n                        Indications from the 1992 assessment surveys and preliminary\n                        data from the 1993 fishery are that the 1991 year class is also\n                        average in size. The effect of uncertainty in the acoustic target\n                        strength estimate was examined by comparing stock synthesis runs\n                        using a target strength of -35 dB/kg (the standard value) and a\n                        more conservative target strength of -33.5 dB/kg. The estimated\n                        1992 biomass for a target strength of -33.5 dB/kg is 2.317  \n                        million t, 25% lower than the estimated biomass for a -35 dB/kg\n                        model. Recruitment estimates and fishery selectivity coefficients\n                        from the stock synthesis model were used with an age-structured\n                        simulation model to estimate sustainable yield. A deterministic\n                        version of the model was used to forecast yields for 1994-96.\n                        Several harvesting strategies are presented: a constant F strategy,\n                        a variable F strategy (where fishing mortality for a particular year is\n                        proportional to the level of female spawning biomass), and a\n                        hybrid strategy that combines features of the other two policies.\n                        Three harvest rates are presented for each harvest strategy. These\n                        harvest rates are set based on the probability that female spawning\n                        biomass will fall below a cautionary level of 623,000 t in long-term\n                        simulations of the Pacific whiting population. When a hybrid fishing\n                        strategy is applied to the projected numbers at age in 1994, the\n                        potential total yield is calculated to be 325,000 t at a low harvest\n                        rate, 450,000 t at a moderate harvest rate, and 555,000 t at a high\n                        harvest rate. The dependence of our recommendations on one\n                        acoustic biomass estimate is an important consideration in seeing\n                        short-term yields from the fishery. It seems reasonable to require\n                        at least two corroborating surveys before substantially increasing\n                        the potential yields for a fishery. For this reason, we recommend a\n                        low harvest rate for 1994-96. If recruitment remains near the\n                        1960-92 median recruitment of 0.941 billion fish, the outlook for\n                        the immediate future is for a fairly rapid decline in annual yield in\n                        1995 and 1996. The recruitment of a strong year class to the\n                        fishery would substantially increase the projected yields.",

The National Marine Fisheries Service's quantitative estimates of recruitment are obtained from models of stock assessment and stock projection employing information generated by FOCI. To generate its information FOCI convenes disciplinary specialists to assemble and analyze relevant time series of biological and physical parameters with respect to recruitment of fish. Statistical methods encompass nonlinear regression, transfer function modeling, nonlinear response surface analysis, and tree-modeling regression. The current database consists of about 30 years of data, and analyses have identified factors that affect ocean stratification and circulation during spring and summer of the fish's birth year as being important to recruitment. Actual recruitment during the past several years has corroborated FOCI's predictions.",

Stretching is implemented here for the vertical coordinate of an oceanic model that employs Chebyshev polynomials to\nrepresent the vertical structure. A three-dimensional test demonstrates how, for a fixed number of vertical levels, the technique may permit\ngreater accuracy in the simulation of linear internal waves, by allowing the placement of grid points closer to the regions of maximum\ncurvature in the represented velocity fields. A one-dimensional test demonstrates enhanced resolution of mixed-layer dynamics by allowing\nthe placement of more of the available grid points, evenly spaced, near the ocean surface, with broader spacing below. These\nimprovements are achieved with negligible computational overhead. While the method cannot yield improved accuracy for all situations, in\nappropriate cases it permits reduced computation for an accurate result by reducing the number of basis functions necessary for adequate\nresolution of the modeled fields. Some guidelines are presented for its application, along with cautions as to where the technique is\ndisadvantageous.",

The dense fluid resulting from a rapid deep convective process serves as a powerful reservoir of both mass and energy. Energy flux\ndue to superinertial waves precedes mass flux. Both mass and energy are ultimately carried away from the local site of convection through\nbaroclinic instability. Analytical and numerical methods are employed to investigate the relative amounts of potential energy radiated to the\nfar field by either process, and the rates at which this is accomplished. An analytical solution is developed for the superinertial transients\ngenerated during linear, axisymmetric gravitational adjustment of a unit step. Initial energy decay by axisymmetric gravitational collapse is\ngreater for a narrow chimney than for a wide one, but ultimately this is equaled and surpassed by the steady spreading of the wide chimney\nvia its baroclinic breakup into smaller structures.",

            "description": "A coupled biophysical model is used to hindcast the early life history of a population of walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), to\nassess possible physical causes of interannual variability in recruitment. The modelling approach combines a primitive equation, rigid-lid\nhydrodynamic model with a probabilistic, individual-based biological model of growth, development, and mortality. Individuals are tracked\nthrough space using daily velocity fields generated from the hydrodynamic model, along with self-directed vertical migrations appropriate\nto each life stage in the biological model. The hydrodynamic model is driven with wind and runoff time series appropriate to each year.\nBiological model output compares favourably with observed spatial distributions for specific years. Lloyd's index of patchiness, calculated\nfrom model output, was similar to values calculated from field data. Five non-contiguous years were chosen for hindcasts to span a wide\nrange of meteorological conditions (winds, runoff) and recruitment success. Interannual comparisons suggest that two years of above\naverage recruitment (1978 and 1988), and one year of below average recruitment (1991), experienced flow fields which carried many\nindividuals into the Alaskan Stream. At the same time, the vigorous flow fields generated in each of these years carried some individuals\nonto the shelf area to the south-west of the spawning site. A year with low runoff and weak winds (1989) exhibited weak circulation, with\nextended retention of larvae near the spawning site. A year with high runoff (1987) was notable for the strength and frequency of\nmesoscale eddy activity. Eddies appear capable of both enhancing patchiness of early larvae (through retention) and dissipating patchiness\nof juveniles (through mesoscale mixing). Larvae retained in an eddy feature exhibit a narrower range of sizes than the population outside\nthat feature.",

Comparisons were made between Steller sea lion\n                        counts and Pollock fishery data from the same year and from 1 to\n                        5 years prior. Two sets of study areas were used, one\n                        encompassing 60 nmi or 120 nmi blocks around six major\n                        rookeries and another with 13 sites defined by 20 nmi radius rings\n                        around major rookeries. Lacking accurate measures of local\n                        Pollock biomass, harvest data were used as approximations of\n                        annual differences in Pollock abundance. Following methods used\n                        in Loughlin and Merrick (1989), correlation coefficients were\n                        calculated using a linear model and tested for significance using a\n                        2-tailed null hypothesis ( = 0.05). However, since the data are\n                        probably not normally distributed, Kendall's coefficients of rank\n                        correlation were also calculated and tested for significance            \n                        ( = 0.05).\n\n                        Using the parametric approach, some significant positive\n                        correlation were obtained comparing sea lion counts to Pollock\n                        harvests 1 to 5 years prior (2 in the first set of comparisons and 8\n                        in the second). These may indicate circumstances where Pollock\n                        abundance was adequate to sustain the fishery while sea lion\n                        abundance remained unaffected. Significant negative correlation\n                        (2 in each set of comparisons) may suggest instances where areas\n                        of low Pollock biomass were effectively harvested, but the low or\n                        reduced availability of prey, or the fishing activity itself, could have\n                        affected Steller sea lion abundance 3 to 5 years later.\n\n                        Only two of the significant correlation found in the parametric\n                        approach were detected using Kendall's rank correlation test. We\n                        conclude that any potential relationship between sea lion\n                        abundance and Pollock harvest can not be properly determined\n                        from these data.",

This model was used: (i) to assess how much of the observed change in larval positions\nduring that period can be explained by transport at fixed depth; (ii) to demonstrate that observed change can be related to mean\nlarge-scale meteorological forcing; and (iii) to investigate accumulation of larvae in specific areas near the coast. Based on availability of\nlarval and circulation data, three years were studied: 1988, 1989 and 1991. Velocity fields generated from a hydrodynamic model driven\nby winds and runoff were used to advect particles seeded in accordance with observed larval distributions in late April of each year. The\nmodelled larvae were tracked at 40 m depth, corresponding to the mean depth of sampled larvae and the depth of neutrally buoyant\ndrifters employed in field studies. Specific features observed in late May larval surveys were reproduced by the model, such as the\naccumulation of larvae in a shoal area downstream of the strait. Differences among the modelled years include extensive flushing of larvae\nto the south-west in 1988 and 1991, vs. limited flushing in 1989. These differences appear related to the mean large-scale atmospheric\npressure patterns for April-May of those years.",

This paper\ndescribes the development and sensitivity analysis of the model, while a companion paper [Stabeno and Hermann, this issue]\ndemonstrates correspondence with measured currents in specific years. The model is initialized with a salinity field derived from local\nconductivity-temperature-depth surveys and forced with an idealized alongshore wind stress pattern. Buoyancy forcing is achieved by\nfreshening the salinity field along a portion of the coastal wall. The model exhibits many of the patterns evident in observations, including\nmean flows and mesoscale eddies associated with the Alaska Coastal Current (ACC). Sensitivity studies suggest a strong dependence of\nthe barotropic flux of the ACC on local winds and weak dependence on upstream buoyancy forcing. Both wind and buoyancy forcing\nsignificantly affect the generation of eddies. Strong northeasterly winds enhance cross-shelf flow of the ACC to the west of Shelikof Strait,\nwhere isobaths veer southward. Strong buoyancy forcing also favors cross-shelf flow in that region and enhances the formation of eddies.",

These flows intermingle in turbulent mixing zones,\nwhere the flow from any incoming layer can be split into two parts: an efflux fraction, which continues on into the next reach, and a reflux\nfraction, which mixes vertically and recirculates into its original reach. Using conservation of mass, we define these fractions and express\nthem in terms of the salinities observed in the reaches. The processes of the complex mixing zones need not be considered in detail. These\nideas are applicable to complicated branched fjords and linked sequences of reaches. Where more than two reaches meet at a multiple\njunction the conservation of two tracers (usually fresh water and salt) is insufficient to determine completely the efflux/reflux fractions. We\npropose an entropy maximization technique to resolve the uncertainty. Long-term pollutant concentrations relate directly to the circulation\nvia the new efflux/reflux formulation. The method demonstrates that refluxing leads to conservative pollutants being broadcast throughout\nthe fjord system with magnified concentrations. A new quantity, the mean tracer age, provides a relevant time scale that includes the\neffects of recirculation and to which the rates of non-conservative processes should be compared. Conservative pollutants may be\nretained for a surprisingly long time in a refluxing system.",

The recirculation is para-meterized in\nterms of efflux/reflux coefficients at distinct mixing zones. The mass fluxes and efflux/reflux coefficients are determined from long-term\nsalinity and current meter observations. The model provides a way to predict the mean concentrations of pollutants introduced within the\nsystem. An application to Puget Sound shows that different discharge sites markedly affect the concentrations landward of the sites\nthemselves.",

The principal components successfully separate axial winds over Puget Sound from cross-axial winds. Energy spectra of\nwinter axial winds contain significant peaks at synoptic-scale periods of 1.5-5 days but also a strong peak of unknown origin at 17 days.\nCross-axial winds are dominated by the land-sea breeze. Day-night asymmetries in the land-sea temperature contrast lead to diurnal\nmodulation and energy at the semidiurnal period. The land breeze persists in winter over Puget Sound, but the sea breeze dominates a\nweakened land breeze in summer.",

            "description": "Salmonid (Oncorhynchus spp.) bycatch data from the 1989 U.S.,\n                        Canada, and Japan monitoring program for Japanese squid driftnet\n                        vessels were analyzed. Sampling effort was consistently less than\n                        expected by proportionate sampling between 170\u00b0E and 180\u00b0\n                        long., especially during the first part of the month when capture of\n                        salmonids would most likely occur. Salmonid incidence (the\n                        proportion of monitored operations encountering salmonids) was\n                        highest at the western and eastern boundaries of the fishery.\n\n                        Fishing-effort data for the bycatch calculations were divided into\n                        three categories: a portion represented by observer data, an\n                        unrepresented portion that could be estimated by extrapolation of\n                        sampled data, and an unrepresented portion that could not be\n                        estimated. The observers reported a catch of 79 salmonids in 57\n                        monitored operations (4% of total fishing effort). For the estimated\n                        portion (81% of total fishing effort), a bycatch estimator based on\n                        an extension of Aitchison's delta distribution produced a bycatch\n                        estimate of 2,648 salmonids. Although the unestimated portion of\n                        Japanese fishing effort is small, salmonid bycatches there may have\n                        been significant; a Republic of Korea research vessel operating in\n                        an unsampled portion of the fishing area and using 37 tans of\n                        driftnet caught 13 salmonids. This represents over 16% of the total\n                        salmon observed in 1,427,225 tans through the monitoring\n                        program.\n\n                        The problem of unestimated strata may be unique to migratory\n                        species like salmonids which are found only within a small portion\n                        of the total fishing area. In addition, the warm ocean conditions of\n                        1989 probably displaced salmonids northward, restricting the\n                        amount of fishing area intersecting salmonid waters, and inducing\n                        some of the estimation problems associated with our data.",

Track lines and oceanographic survey stations are fixed and sampled every year for the years 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1999. Water temperature and salinity profile data were collected at 40 oceanographic research stations by a CTD system. At each CTD station chlorophyll and zooplankton abundance were measured. Zooplankton were sampled with a bongo net using a 333-micron mesh codend and sorted to genus. Biological samples of pollock were taken as fish schools were encountered. Pollock data included length-frequency data, sex ratio measurements and otolith samples for age determination.",

The value of these fishery exports\n                        declined by 16.2% to $2.15 billion. Although there were declines\n                        in exports of Groundfish, salmon, crab, and herring, the decrease in\n                        total exports was primarily due to the 25% decline in Groundfish\n                        exports and the 10.5% decline in salmon exports. In 1993,\n                        Groundfish exports of $833 million and salmon exports of $798\n                        million accounted for 38.7 and 37%, respectively, of the total\n                        value of Pacific Northwest fishery exports. The value of Pacific\n                        Northwest exports comprised 72.7% of total U.S. edible fishery\n                        exports, down from 76.6% in 1992. In 1993, Pacific Northwest\n                        exports were shipped to 37 countries with the top 4 countries\n                        accounting for 94% of the total. Except for increased trade with\n                        Canada and the People's Republic of China, trade of fishery\n                        products declined with the major importing countries (Japan,\n                        Republic of Korea, the United Kingdom, France, and Australia).\n                        Exports to Japan totaled $1.7 billion or 79.7% of the total, down\n                        16.7% in value from $2.06 billion in 1992. Canada jumped to the\n                        second spot with shipments increasing by nearly 50% to $142\n                        million or 6.6% of total exports.

            "description": "With the projected development of petroleum and natural gas reserves in Alaska, the waters of northern Puget Sound and the Strait of\nJuan de Fuca may become major transportation routes through which Alaskan petroleums are delivered to Washington State refineries.\nAssociated with increased production of the refineries will be the exportation of refined products to markets outside the State of\nWashington. The seasonal distributions of total suspended solids were determined for the area north of Admiralty Inlet, east of Port\nAngeles, and south of the Fraser River between November 1976 and August 1977. Typical values ranged from 0.5 to 2 mg l with the\nhighest concentrations observed near the Fraser River (8 mg l) and Deception Pass (2-3 mg l). Vertical distributions of suspended\nparticulate matter (SPM) showed highest values in the surface and near bottom waters. High surface concentrations are believed to be due\nto seasonal/temporal fresh water runoff and primary production; elevated levels near the bottom are probably related to resuspension\nprocesses. Seasonal variability was insignificant on a regional basis except for areas directly influenced by river runoff. Diurnal variability\nwas most pronounced near major sediment sources and at stations characterized by large tidal excursions. In a complementary study,\nLANDSAT images were utilized to study surface trajectories of sediment plumes originating from the Fraser and Skagit Rivers. Major\nsediment plumes originating from the Fraser River can be traced across the Strait of Georgia and through Porlier, Active, and Boundary\nPasses. Trajectories during the ebb tide are southeast along the coast; but during flood tide, the trajectory is west and northwest along the\nnorthern coast of Galiano Island. Sediment plumes originating from the distributaries of the Skagit River are most pronounced in early\nsummer. At this time suspended sediments from the Skagit River can be traced as far south as the middle of Saratoga Passage and as far\nnorth as Deception Pass. As a corollary to the suspended sediment distribution studies, the composition and abundance of hydrocarbons\nassociated with suspended matter was evaluated at five strategic locations in the northern Puget Sound region. Hydrocarbons extracted\nfrom suspended matter ranged from 0.2 mg g to 1.4 mg g  dry weight. Major identifiable paraffins were largely biogenic (e.g.,\npentadecane, heptadecane, pristane, etc.), although one sample taken near the Fraser River may have been contaminated with motor oil.\nSimilarly, samples taken from the Strait of Juan de Fuca show the possible presence of weathered petroleum residues (i.e., tar balls),\nwhich is not unexpected given the level of transportation activity in this area. Within the limits of these few data, we conclude that\nsuspended matter in these waters is not obviously contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons, but low levels of contaminants may be\npresent that were not identifiable because of the modicum concentrations of suspended matter present. Laboratory measurements also\nwere performed under simulated natural conditions to investigate the short-term interaction between Prudhoe Bay crude oil and two\nlocally-derived riverine sediments. These experiments showed that significant concentrations of crude oil may be accommodated on\nsuspended matter under optimum conditions. Skagit River sediments, being significantly coarser than suspended material from the Fraser\nRiver, accommodated and settled up to 100% its weight in oil at 10\u00b0C (S = 32), but only 40% at 15\u00b0C (S = 23). When smaller\nparticles (Fraser River) were subjected to the same experimental conditions, considerably less oil was sedimented (up to 17%). However,\nmuch of the remaining oil and sediment was present in a surface slick. Experiments show that significant amounts of oil may be\naccommodated on suspended sediments, but the quantity retained will depend on the isoelectric point of the oil and sediment particles,\nparticle size, temperature, and the concentration of oil relative to that of sediments.",

A total of 36 stations were occupied along three 360-nautical-mile N-S transects centered\nat 15\u00b0N, 126\u00b0W; 11\u00b040N,138\u00b025W; and 8\u00b025N, 150\u00b040W. In general, the water column showed typical open-ocean SPM\nconcentrations: 20-100 \u00b5g liter in the euphotic zone, <15 \u00b5g liter in the intermediate and deep waters, and a slight increase in the\nbottom waters. Distributions of SPM within the upper 200 m varied both zonally and meridionally, apparently in response to the equatorial\ncurrent systems. The highest SPM concentrations occurred above the inferred divergence between the North Equatorial Current and the\nNorth Equatorial Countercurrent. Temporal changes in the SPM distribution were noted. Seasonal variations were slight, except for\nchanges attributable to migration of the upwelling zone associated with the equatorial current systems. Diurnal variations were measured\nduring 38-hour time series observations at three stations and consisted of 10- to 20-m vertical excursions of the SPM contours that\noccurred with a period of 4 to 20 hours or less. Elemental chemistry analysis by thin-film x-ray fluorescence indicates that most (>85\npercent) of the SPM in the surface, intermediate, and deep waters is of biogenic origin. Increased SPM concentration in the bottom water\nis a result of an increase in the nonbiogenic (aluminosilicate) fraction by resuspension of local bottom sediments. These baseline\nmeasurements provide information concerning the natural variability of SPM in a proposed mining area. Background values of SPM may\nbe used to assess environmental changes caused by deep-sea mining operations. Monitoring of a mining debris plume by optical or\ngravimetric methods is feasible only while its concentration above the ambient SPM significantly exceeds the natural variability. Chemical\nanalysis of collected SPM, however, should allow detection of even relatively low concentrations of the predominantly nonbiogenic mining\ndebris.",

SPM concentrations in the surface waters (0-300 m)\nwere highly variable (~30 \u00b1 18 \u00b5g/1) and primarily dependent on the concentration of biogenic material which accounted for >90% of the\ntotal SPM. Mean Si/Al, K/Al, Ti/Al ratios were significantly higher than the corresponding values for the underlying sediments, indicating\nprobable concentration of these elements in biogenic matter and other nonaluminosilicate phases. Mn/Al ratios, however, were close to or\neven less than the sediment values. Particle concentrations, mean size, and Si/Al, K/Al, Ti/Al, and Fe/Al ratios all decreased from the\nsurface waters to the top of the bottom nepheloid layer (BNL), indicating progressive dissolution and a concomitant remineralization of\nassociated elements. However, nonaluminosilicate phases still accounted for more than 40-70% of the Si, K, Ti, and Fe in the deep water\nzone. After deposition, most of this nonaluminosilicate phase is either transformed into authigenic smectites or dissolved and released back\ninto the water column. Within the BNL (approximately the bottom 400 m of the water column), concentration increases of Al, Si, K, Ti,\nMn, and Fe averaged 201%, 74%, 46%, 78%, 200%, and 119%, respectively, greater than the overlying waters, whereas total SPM\nincreased only 20-40%. Chemical mass-balance calculations suggest that this BNL concentration increase is due to resuspension of\naluminosilicates and hydrogenous Mn from the 1 \u00b5m fraction of the local bottom sediments.",

The\nsystem features a new sequentially sampling sediment trap which collects and seals 10 separate samples during a single deployment.\nHorizontal particle fluxes are simultaneously monitored with a beam transmissometer interfaced to a standard Aanderaa current meter.\nResults from a 10-week deployment of instruments at several depths in a deep fjord estuary indicate that the trapping rate increases from\n0.5 g m day at 20 m to 150 g m day at 200 m (5 m above bottom) because of frequent erosion in the deep waters. Periodic flushing\nof the deep water by intrusions of marine water over the seaward sill markedly enhances erosion and causes an up-estuary particle\ntransport comparable to the vertical particle flux originating at the surface.",

The particle distribution differs from the distribution of hydrographic properties and is characterized by four persistent features: (1) a thin (<10 m), high-turbidity surface layer, (2) a thick (~50 m), low-turbidity zone centered around the level of no net motion between net seaward and landward flow, (3) horizontal particle fronts at the sill entrances, and (4) a bottom nepheloid layer maintained by local resuspension. Removal of particles from the surface waters by advective downwelling at the seaward sill and gravitational settling throughout the basin make Puget Sound and efficient particle trap. Particles sedimented on the basin floor are transported preferentially landward by the action of erosion/deposition cycles enhanced by fortnightly intrusions of new marine water.",

Surface and bottom high-turbidity layers are present throughout the bay during both summer and winter seasons. Particles added to the surface layer by river input and phytoplankton production are rapidly advected out of the bay and provide only a minor contribution to the local sedimentation rate. The benthic nepheloid layer is maintained not by local resuspension but by particles advected into Elliott Bay with turbid deep water from the adjoining Main Basin of Puget Sound. A severalfold drop in mean current speed as Main Basin water enters\nElliott Bay results in increased particle fallout within the benthic nepheloid layer, a high sedimentation rate, and the embayment functioning as a sink for particles from throughout Puget Sound.",
