            "description": "Analyses of data from three shipborne surveys describe the quasi-synoptic\n     density and velocity fields near Barrow Canyon, Alaska. The canyon parallels the\n     northwestern coast of Alaska and contains three different water masses. These\n     are 1) warm and fresh Alaskan coastal waters that originate from the Bering\n     Strait; 2) cold and moderately salty waters that originate from the Chukchi shelf;\n     and 3) warm and salty waters that originate from the Atlantic layer of the Arctic\n     Ocean. A halocline separates the Chukchi shelf and Atlantic layer waters. The\n     halocline slopes upward into the canyon where it is then twisted to slope across\n     the wide canyon. An intensification of the Beaufort gyre near the shelf break just\n     seaward of Barrow Canyon raises the halocline more than 100 m toward the\n     surface. Locally upwelling favorable winds raise the Arctic halocline, which thus is\n     ventilated within Barrow Canyon adjacent to the coast. In the absence of winds\n     the halocline slopes across-canyon in the thermal wind sense due to a northward\n     flowing coastal current.\n\n       Velocity measurements from a towed acoustic Doppler current profiler reveal a\n     northward flowing jet that transports about 0.3 Sv (Sv  106 kg m3) of Bering\n     Sea summer water into the Arctic Ocean at speeds that exceed 0.7 m s1. Total\n     northward transports through the canyon exceed 1.0 Sv. The warm waters of this\n     coastal current supply more than 100 W m2 of heat to the atmosphere. The jet\n     separates both from the bottom and from the coast. Hence, a laterally and\n     vertically sheared jet forms, which breaks into three branches at about 71.8\u00b0N\n     latitude.",
