Other Comments
"Trawl catch and effort data is available from 1954-1995.  Information for trap is available from 1979-1995 and longline information is available from 1979-1985.  
Collection of catch and effort data is continuing but data will be housed in a new 
relational database that is in its final phases of development.
Throughout the years the GFCATCH database has evolved and most changes have only been documented internally.  Please contact the custodian for more details on the database."
