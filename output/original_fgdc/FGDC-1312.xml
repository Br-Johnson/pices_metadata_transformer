        <p>REFM scientists conducted a study of shortraker (Sebastes borealis) and rougheye (Sebastes aleutianus) rockfish near Adak Island, Alaska, with the submersible Delta during 27-30 July.  Moss Landing Marine Laboratory assisted with the data collection. A total of 12 dives and 39 transects were completed during the 4 days of sampling.  Each dive consisted of approximately three 20-minute transects during which an observer collected data on species identification, distance of fish from submersible, habitat type, and size of specimen. The dive locations were identified as shortraker and rougheye habitat from historical bottom trawl research surveys.  Line transects were then conducted at depths of 300-350 m. The four sampling days were divided between the north and south side of the Aleutian Islands.  A variety of habitats were encountered, ranging from flat, sandy areas to steep rocky outcrops.  An example of the latter type of habitat was the eastern portion of Adak Canyon, where three dives were conducted. Each dive was videotaped using two cameras, and these tapes will be analyzed in order to estimate rockfish densities within the different habitat types.</p>
