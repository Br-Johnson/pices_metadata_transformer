      <abstract>GEOSAT Geophysical Data Records (GDR) - (Raw altimeter data merged with Navy Astronauts Group (NAG) ephemerides, corrected for path-length effects due to troposphere and ionosphere) cover approximately 24 hours each (14 or 15 complete revolutions) beginning and ending as close as possible to 72Â° north (maximum latitude). GDR's are similar to SEASAT and GEOS-3, but include full 10  per second data as well as 1 second averages. GDR's collected over land ice, as well as GDR's over ocean but flagged as "bad" are archived on a separate tape from the ocean GDR's.  These land/ice  GDR's are useful when combined with GEOSAT waveform data records (WDR's).  Altimeter often fails to re-acquire lock when it moves from land or ice to ocean. GDR's contain sea surface height, geoid height, significant wave height, height offset for over land or over ice, solid/fluid tide and wet/dry troposphere corrections, ionosphere correction, and flags indicating reasons for quality test failures.</abstract>
