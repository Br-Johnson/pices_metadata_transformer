        <p>The Bering Sea has been one of the least investigated of the larger bodies of salt water. Opportunity for the study of the physical and chemical conditions of its water was afforded in 1933 and again in 1934.  During these years, investigations were undertaken with the following objectives: (1) To make temperature and chlorinity measurements from which density distribution and resulting currents could be computed, (2) to augment, where it was possible the computed currents with direct currents measurements, and (3) to ascertain the distribution of dissolved oxygen and nutrients salts in that region.</p>
