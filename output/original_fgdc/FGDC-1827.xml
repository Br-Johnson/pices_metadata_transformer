      <abstract>Catch statistics of about 40 commercially important fishes have been recorded since the 1920s, and some additional species were considered necessary and added later.  The Fishery Administration Authority of Korea has collected and published monthly and annual catch data for about 60 fish species.  A list of these fish species can be found on page 149 of the PICES Scientific Report No. 18 2001.  Recently, the National Statistical Office of Korean Government began to archive the fishery data in electronic form.  Monthly and annual catch statistics (fish, 58 species; squids and octopus, 7 species; shellfish, 19 species; shrimps and crabs, 12 species; and macro-algae, 12 species) since 1988 were digitized, and the electronic data can be found at "www.nso.go.kr".
