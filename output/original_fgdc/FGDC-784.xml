      <abstract>Data Type:  ;  Spatially referenced vegetation ground plot data collected over a 12 year period throughout Wrangell St. Elias National Park. Vegetative species information and related canopy cover data was collected from ground plots. Plots have been classified using the Alaska Vegetation Classification Scheme. All plots have been referenced on Alaska High Altitude Color Infrared photography at 1:63360 scale. The collection of this data was supported by the regional fire program to provide ground information as to fire fuels for Wrangell St. Elias National Park. These plots have been used for other applications as supportive information for landcover mapping, habitat interpretations, general vegetation knowledge, etc. A Vegetation Survey effort has been underway at the park for approximately 12 years and recently has expanded. Rare plant surveys are currently being conducted as well. All collection points are now spatially referenced with GPS systems.</abstract>
