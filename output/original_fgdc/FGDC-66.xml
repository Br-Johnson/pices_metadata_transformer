        <title>Deducing Anomalous Wave Source Regions during the Life Cycles of Persistent Flow Anomalies</title>

      <abstract>Anomalous wave source regions are identified during the life cycles of
     persistent flow anomalies occurring over the North Pacific and North
     Atlantic Oceans during boreal winter. These cases project strongly upon the
     PacificﾖNorth American and Eastern Atlantic teleconnection patterns,
     respectively, and represent two of the primary modes of intraseasonal low
     frequency variability in the Northern Hemisphere wintertime circulation. In
     the upper troposphere, these cases are manifested by wave trains of
     large-scale and large amplitude flow anomalies extending downstream from
     key regions near the Aleutian Islands and south of Iceland, respectively. The
     occurrence of persistent flow anomalies is closely linked to persistent
     extremes in surface weather and to variations in the skill of extended-range
     weather forecasts. Black and Dole performed a detailed diagnostic analysis
     of the onset of persistent cyclonic flow anomalies over the North Pacific. A
     key result of their study was that wave activity flux diagnoses correctly
     identified the location of anomalous wave source regions.

       Black and Doleﾒs study is extended by diagnosing three-dimensional
     fluxes of wave activity during the onset, maintenance, and decay of cyclonic
     and anticyclonic persistent flow anomalies over the North Atlantic and North
     Pacific regions. The flux characterizes large-scale wave propagation, and the
     flux divergence is used to deduce the location of regional sources and sinks
     of anomalous wave activity. In all cases there is a marked upward and
     downstream flux of wave activity emanating from the lower troposphere near
     the key region. The results are consistent with a local wave source and
     Rossby-like wave propagation away from the source. There is little evidence
     that anomalous remote processes directly force persistent flow anomaly life
     cycles. The diagnostic analyses indicate that the primary anomalous wave
     sources for both cyclonic and anticyclonic persistent flow anomalies are local
     to the region of their occurrence. It remains possible, however, that
     anomalous remote forcing plays an indirect or catalytic role in some cases.</abstract>
