      <abstract>First it was sea lion populations that started to disappear along the rocky coast of southwest Alaska's Aleutian Islands. Next came harbor seals. Now scientists say sea otter numbers in the Aleutians are so low that they're likely to be listed as an endangered species before the year is out. As Doug Schneider reports in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio, scientists now must figure out how to save Alaska's most adorable marine mammal.</abstract>
      <purpose>The story of Alaska's sea otters reads like many of the boom-then-bust stories of the far north. In the 1740s, just before the Russians showed up in what is now Alaska, sea otters were thought to number in the hundreds of thousands. Over the next 170 years, hunting by the Russians, and then the Americans, pushed the sea otter to the brink of extinction. By the time hunting was banned in 1911, sea otters were all but extinct across Alaska.</purpose>
