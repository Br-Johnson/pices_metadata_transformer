      <abstract>The University of Alaska's Institute of Marine Science is in possession of a proprietary data set compiled by Scientific Fishery Systems Inc. This bathymetric data set consists of NODC soundings point data which has been translated to NAD83 where necessary. The data is of very high resolution near some coastal areas and very coarse in others, in the deeper parts of the continental shelf and open ocean, there is hardly any coverage at all. A map individual data points in this data set is shown below. For more information on this data set see the SciFish website http://www.scifish.com/newWeb/productIndiv.py?2.

  In order to get a high resolution bathymetric data set which was capable of supplying a numerical model with adequate coverage on a 3 km grid the SALMON Project group at UAF decided to combine a number of data sets. For the deep ocean, we decided to use ETOPO5 a global data set of land and sea elevations on a 5 minute latitude/longitude grid. For the coastal areas the SciFish data set was used and for the land the Smith and Sandwell 30 second gridded data was used. Routines written in the feely available software package called the Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) were used to combine these three data sets, grid them all onto a 30 second latitude/longitude grid and produce maps.
