      <abstract>The southeastern Bering Sea shelf is an economically and ecologically important ecosystem subject to considerable natural variability. This variability influences the magnitude of primary production and its vertical and horizontal distribution which, in turn, influences the productivity of higher trophic levels over a large range of temporal and spatial scales. Nutrients are vital to maintain the elevated biomass observed on the shelf and must be continually injected into the euphotic zone to counter losses of phytoplankton to grazing, advection and burial. We focus here on exploring physical processes at the shelf edge and outer shelf, particularly instabilities and eddies in the Bering Slope Current that result in the advection of nutrient rich waters onto the shelf. While such processes have been observed to occur, their impact on the Bering Sea shelf ecosystem has yet to be described.

We will use altimeter data from remote sensing to describe mesoscale circulation variability and to identify episodic events of onshelf flow. Satellite tracked drifters will be released to monitor currents and the temporal evolution of ocean color along the slope. One sampling expedition per year for two years will provide detailed information on the dynamics of the Bering Slope Current/Aleutian North Slope Current (BSC/ANSC) system and on bio-optical relationships between phytoplankton biomass and ocean color. Finally, the stability of the BSC/ANSC system will be examined using an analytical, jet-turning-a-corner model. This research will provide collaborating researchers a regional
context within which to interpret contemporaneous drifter, hydrographic, biological, and bio-optical data acquired from the shelf/slope region of the southeastern Bering Sea.
