      <abstract>During the summer and fall of 1980, 1983, and 1986, the National
                        Marine Fisheries Service and the Fisheries Agency of Japan
                        conducted comprehensive trawl surveys of the Groundfish
                        resources of the Aleutian Islands. The survey area included the
                        continental shelf and upper slope from Stalemate Bank to Unimak
                        Pass, including Bowers Ridge and a portion of the southern Bering
                        Sea.

                        The major objectives of these surveys were to define the
                        distribution and abundance of commercial Groundfish species and
                        to assess changes in stock abundance and biological conditions
                        over the 6-year survey period. Results of each of these yearly
                        surveys include distribution information, biomass and population
                        estimates, size and age composition, and length weight data for
                        most species of commercial fish. This paper presents and
                        compares the data from each of the three surveys.

                        The average total biomass estimate for the three surveys was 2.4
                        million metric tons. Fish made up over 96% of this biomass, and
                        included 161 species representing 40 families. Nineteen species
                        made up over 90% of the total available biomass. Accounting for
                        23% of the available biomass, walleye Pollock (Theragra
                        chalcogramma) with a similar biomass estimate each year was
                        the most abundant species. Giant grenadier (Albatrossia
                        pectoralis), a non-utilized species was the second most abundant
                        species with an increasing biomass which accounted for 18% of
                        the available resource. The other abundant species were Atka
                        mackerel (Pleurogrammus monopterygius), Pacific ocean perch
                        (Sebastes alutus), and Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus),
                        accounting for 16, 8, and 7% of the resource, respectively.</abstract>
