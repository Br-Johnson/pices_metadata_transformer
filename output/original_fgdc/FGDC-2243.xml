        <p>The U.S. results of a joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. expedition to the Bering Sea in 1984 investigated the chemical and biological interactions in the south, east, north and west regions. The nutrients, phytoplankton biomass and primary productivity were enhanced near the ends of a north-south transect of stations. The southern end of the transect had characteristics of the North Pacific Ocean with high nutrient and low phytoplankton concentrations and an elevated concentration of peridinin indicative of dinoflagellates.</p>
        <p>The middle station of the transect, near the shelf break, had low nutrients and phytoplankton in the upper euphotic zone, but a submerged chlorophyll b maximum indicated green algae was located on the upper boundary of high ammonium concentration and pycnocline. The north end of the transect over the shelf at mid-depth on the boundary of high nitrate and ammonium concentrations produced the highest primary production. Pigment analysis (chlorophyll a, diadinoxanthin and fucoxanthin) indicated the dominance of diatoms and was coincidental to oxygen saturation values as large as 150%. The highest phaeophorbide a concentrations were also observed in this area, suggesting relatively high grazing stress. Measurements of low molecular weight hydrocarbons also suggest high microbiological degradation rates of organic matter in the sediments in the north region. Overall, this research strongly relates nutrient, oxygen and pigment concentrations to the production, decomposition and recycling processes in the open ocean and shelf areas of the Bering Sea.</p>
