      <abstract>DMSP F8 SSM/I Monthly Averaged Sea Ice Concentration for the Polar Regions 
for July 1987 through December 1991 were produced by NSIDC using the daily
sea ice concentration grids which were generated using the NASATEAM 
algorithm (Cavalieri, et al. 1986, JGR 91(C1), p. 975-994) and distributed
on CD-ROM by NSIDC.  The monthly sea ice grids are available on request
via ftp (see access instructions below), and may eventually be distributed 
on CD-ROM with other SSM/I products.  The monthly sea ice grids can be used 
as a mask to block out ice-covered areas for various applications.  To 
accommodate as many  potential applications as possible, the monthly averaged 
ice extent was delineated using four concentration values (0%, 5%, 10%, and 
15%) for the minimum concentrations included in the averages.  The grids are 
8-bit raster images containing 448 lines of 304 pixels (304x by 448y) for the
northern hemisphere and 332 lines of 316 pixels (316x by 332y) for the
southern.  IDL procedures were used to calculate monthly averages from the
daily-averaged SSM/I grids.  The data were then put into Hierarchical Data
Format (HDF).  Utilities to read and manipulate HDF data are available via
ftp from the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA).  The
NCSA ftp server address is ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu; help is available from
helphdf@ncsa.uiuc.edu.</abstract>
