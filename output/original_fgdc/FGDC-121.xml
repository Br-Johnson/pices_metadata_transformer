      <abstract>NOAA's National Data Buoy Center offers real-time and historical data
from its 114 moored buoys and C-MAN (Coastal-Marine Automated Network)
stations.  Data is transmitted hourly via the Geostationary
Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES).

All stations measure wind speed and direction, wind gust, barometric
pressure and air temperature.  All buoys and some C-MAN stations
measure sea surface temperature, wave height, and wave period.
Monthly and annual climatic summary tables are available.

Stations are located throughout U.S. coastal waters including
U.S. Atlantic coast, U.S. Pacific coast, Gulf of Alaska, Bering Sea,
Gulf of Mexico, Great Lakes and Hawaiian Islands.  Some stations are
also located in the western equatorial Pacific.

Real-time data is available hourly.  After several days, data is
quality-controlled and appended to daily data files.  An archive of
monthly data may also be accessed.  The following types of
quality-controlled data are available: standard meteorological data,
acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) data, continuous winds data,
spectral wave density data, spectral wave direction data, water level
data, and surface ocean current data.

Data is available through NDBC's WWW server using the station locator
map or the station ID list and search:
http://seaboard.ndbc.noaa.gov


Telnet, FTP and BBS service is also available:

"telnet://seaboard.ndbc.noaa.gov"

Anonymous FTP: ftp://seaboard.ndbc.noaa.gov

and give email address as the password

BBS phone number: 601-688-7938
modem settings: 8 data bits, no parity, and 1 stop bit, up to 28.8 Kbps
