      <abstract>Results from the winter 1995 echo integration-trawl survey of
                        spawning walleye Pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) in the
                        southeastern Aleutian Basin near Bogoslof Island are presented.
                        The survey, conducted in two passes between 26 February and 9
                        March, covered an area between 165°51'W and 170°27'W long.,
                        from the Aleutian chain north to between 53° 45' N and 54° 40' N
                        lat. Isolated Pollock aggregations were encountered off the edge
                        of the shelf north of Akutan Island and over deep water northeast
                        of Bogoslof Island. Extremely dense Pollock aggregations were
                        observed along the north side of Umnak Island from 168° W to
                        169° 30' W long. Pollock vertical distribution ranged from 250 m
                        to 750 m below the surface; their average depth was higher in the
                        water column during pass 2 than during pass 1. Sex composition in
                        hauls ranged from 8% to 94% female, averaging around 60%
                        female. Evidence of vertical stratification by sex showed males
                        inhabiting lower depth layers than females. Little evidence of a
                        "non-spawner" component of the Pollock biomass (as had been
                        observed in 1993 and 1994) was observed, and most female
                        Pollock were in a pre-spawning reproductive state. The spawning
                        biomass estimate, 1.10 million metric tons (I), was more than
                        twice the March 1994 estimate of 0.49 million t. This large
                        increase in the Bogoslof spawning population can be partially
                        explained by strong recruitment of Pollock from the 1989 year
                        class. However, population and biomass increases also occurred
                        across most of the age groups. Potential reasons for the population
                        increase are discussed.</abstract>
