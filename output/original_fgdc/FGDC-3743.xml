        <p>World ocean data set  is provided freely in the anonymous ftp directory at Scripps Institute of Oceanography by Drs. Reid and Mantyla, and was formatted for Web by NOAA/PMEL/EPIC. Additional variables, such as neutral density, have been computed and included in the EPIC files. Note: Arctic data is included in the Pacific category.</p>
        <p>Collected data include temperature, salinity, nutrient, oxygen, and silicates.  There are 4714 files available for plotting and download.  Depth ranges from 0 to 10892 meters deep.  On-line access to the data and sectional cross plots is available.  Access to download data from individual casts in either ASCII or netCDF format is included.  A variety of plots of properties versus depth and property versus property plots can be generated on the fly and displayed to your screen.  On-line access to the data are accessible via a number of data selection utilities.  These utilities allow you to search the database and extract datasets meeting criteria such as geographic location, date and time, season of the year, and various other criteria.</p>

      <purpose>These data have been accumulated for the purpose of global ocean studies and are not intended for fine scale analyses.  Each station represents, to our knowledge, the best station available for that locality at the time of the selection.</purpose>
