      <abstract>The structure and condition of walleye pollock in the eastern part of the Bering Sea and adjacent seas were studied using available literature as well as fishery and biological data.  Based on literature review, the three hypotheses of Pollock subpopulation structure were considered to assess the Pollock conditions and thus to make resource management implications.  The three hypotheses were three unit stocks ( the eastern Bering Sea stock, the Aleutian Island stock and the Bogoslof Island-Aleutian Basin stock) two unit stocks (the eastern Bering Sea-Aleutian Islands stock and the Bogoslof Island-Aleutian Basin stock) and single unit (eastern Bering Sea stock) Stock conditions were assessed based on various models and methods according to the three hypotheses.  For the eastern Bering Seas stock in three unit stock hypothesis, the MSY and Fmsy showed 1.73 ~ 2.26 million mt and 0.29 ~ 0.40 respectively.  The Y/R showed maximum level at the 2.6 ~ 2.8 year of tï¾© and spawners per recruit of each unit stocks were 40%, 35%, 38% of SB/R (maximum biomass per recruitment), respectively.  The Y/R of two unit stocks and single unit stock were 0.16 and 0.21 at the level for t(c0=4.7 and F=0.34 respectively.</abstract>
