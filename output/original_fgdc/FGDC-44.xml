        <title>An Elastic-Viscous-Plastic Model for Sea Ice Dynamics</title>

      <abstract>The standard model for sea ice dynamics treats the ice pack as a viscoﾖplastic
material that flows plastically under typical stress conditions but behaves as a linear
viscous fluid where strain rates are small and the ice becomes nearly rigid. Because of
large viscosities in these regions, implicit numerical methods are necessary for time
steps larger than a few seconds. Current solution methods for these equations use
iterative relaxation methods, which are time consuming, scale poorly with mesh
resolution, and are not well adapted to parallel computation. To remedy this, the
authors developed and tested two separate methods. First, by demonstrating that the
viscous-plastic rheology can be represented by a symmetric, negative definite matrix
operator, the much faster and better behaved preconditioned conjugate gradient
method was implemented. Second, realizing that only the response of the ice on
timescales associated with wind forcing need be accurately resolved, the model was
modified so that it reduces to the viscous-plastic model at these timescales, whereas
at shorter timescales the adjustment process takes place by a numerically more
efficient elastic wave mechanism. This modification leads to a fully explicit numerical
scheme that further improves the modelﾒs computational efficiency and is a great
advantage for implementations on parallel machines.

Furthermore, it is observed that the standard viscous-plastic model has poor
dynamic response to forcing on a daily timescale, given the standard time step (1 day)
used by the ice modeling community. In contrast, the explicit discretization of the
elastic wave mechanism allows the elastic-viscous-plastic model to capture the ice
response to variations in the imposed stress more accurately. Thus, the
elastic-viscous-plastic model provides more accurate results for shorter timescales
associated with physical forcing, reproduces viscous-plastic model behavior on longer
timescales, and is computationally more efficient overall.</abstract>
