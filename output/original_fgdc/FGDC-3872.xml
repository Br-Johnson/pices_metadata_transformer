        <p>Oceanographic and meteorological observations from moored buoys and onshore/nearshore platforms (Coastal-Marine Automated  Network (C-MAN) stations).  Most of the stations are located in the coastal and offshore waters of the U.S.  The real-time data is often incorporated into other observing system networks on a regional or local basis.  The state of Alaska has approximately five moored buoys and seven C-MAN stations.  The states of Washington, Oregon, and the northern portion of California have approximately nine moored buoys and seven C-MAN stations. Central and southern California has approximately fifteen moored buoys and two C-MAN stations. The real-time data is often incorporated into other observing system networks on a regional or local basis. The state of Hawaii has approximately five moored buoys.</p>
        <p>Observations include air temperature, dewpoint, sea level pressure, wind speed/direction, wind gust, visibility, current speed/direction, spectral wave density, spectral wave direction, directional wave spectrum, water level, sea surface temperature, average wave period, dominant wave period, and wave direction.</p>
