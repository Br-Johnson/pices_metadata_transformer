      <abstract>Thereﾒs mounting evidence that climate change is causing dramatic changes in the Arctic. As Doug Schneider reports in this weekﾒs Arctic Science Journeys Radio, clues left in the fat of polar bears are helping scientists understand how climate warming threatens the survival of the worldﾒs largest bear.</abstract>
      <purpose>Each fall, hundreds of polar bears gather along the western shore of Canada's Hudson Bay. They arrive gaunt and straggly, having fasted for months as they waited on land for
 winter to return. Within weeks,  though, the bay will be frozen and the bears will be gone, having ventured far onto the ice in search of ringed seals, their favorite prey.

But over the last decade, the bay has been freezing later and melting earlier. Polar bear biologist Dr. Ian Stirling, with the Canadian Wildlife Service, says climate warming is making for shorter winters and that means polar bears aren't finding enough seals to eat.</purpose>
