               This book is a part of the foreign meteorological data collection held by the NOAA Central Library in Washington, DC. Information in this collection dates back to the 18th century for daily, monthly, seasonal, and annual tabular summaries, and the 19th century for weather maps. These data are the result of foreign exchange agreements, but the collection has not been updated since 1983. 

               In these summaries, definitions are: 

               1. Hourly/daily/monthly/seasonal/annual data -- values determined for each consecutive period, e.g. monthly temperature data: January 1900, February 1900, etc. 

               2. Long-term data -- values determined over a period of years, e.g. long-term monthly temperature data using January 1901, January 1902, etc. 

               This book contains tables, maps, and graphs of hourly, daily, and monthly surface weather during the voyage of Veda from Cape North to Yokohama via Bering Strait (1878-1879) 

               Tables contain the following data: 

               -hourly pressure, temperature, humidity, wind, and clouds -monthly mean temperature and pressure
               -monthly wind frequency -seasonal mean winds for specific places -annual mean wind direction
               -annual number of days with snow 

               Graphs contain the following data: 
-daily mean temperature for the points en route the Veda expedition from Cape North to Yokohama -hourly temperature , pressure, and winds for Pitlekaie for January 26-28, 1899 -daily precipitation for Pitlekaie 

Map contains the following data: 

-mean trajectories of squalls for the Bering Strait</abstract>
