        <p>This report references geographic distribution, population abundance, production, size distribution, and species composition data of algal species; species composition data of fish species; diet, geographic distribution, size distribution, and species composition data of invertebrate species; and diet data of sea otters (Enhydra lutris).  Referenced algal species include: Alaria spp., Fucus  distichus, Laminaria spp., and Zostera marina.  Referenced fish species include: Ammodytes hexapterus, Anoplarchus purpurescans, Clupea pallasi, Hexagrammos stelleri, and Pholis laeta.  Referenced invertebrate species include: Clinocardium spp., Dermasterias imbricata, Evasterias troschelii, Littorina scutulata, Littorina sitkana, Macoma spp., Modiolus modiolus, Mya spp, Mytilus  trossulus, Protothaca staminea, Saxidomus giganteus, Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis, and Telmessus cheiragonus.  Referenced geographic areas include: Chugach Bay, Koyuktolik Bay, and Port Dick, Cook Inlet, Alaska.</p>

        <p>This literature was collected as part of a metadatabase that represents one or more nearshore resources (from physical attributes such as water and air, to birds and mammals).  Each entry is viewable in three formats, 1) a geospatial explicit format (ArcView 3.3) named GIS ArcView 3.3 Near GEM project, 2) a spreadsheet format (Excel 2002 and within ArcView) named GEM Nearshore Metadata Set, and 3) a ProCite database named GEM Nearshore Metadata References, which consists of references included in 1 and 2 above.  The ProCite database record number corresponds to the Excel Procite Number.  Reference Procite #590 for this literature's metadata.</p>
        <p>The metadata are maintained in digital format (ArcView 3.3, Excel 2002, and Procite) and are available from the Alaska Science Center, USGS in Anchorage, Alaska.</p>
        <p>For a detailed description of the three databases and the project, see "Bodkin, J. L., and T. Dean.  2003.  Alternative Sampling Designs for Nearshore Monitoring (Gulf Ecosystem Monitoring and Research Project G-030687), US Geological Survey, Alaska Science Center, Anchorage, Alaska." available on-line at http://www.evostc.state.ak.us/pdf/GEM_final_reports/030687.pdf.</p>

      <purpose>Part of the design effort of the "Alternative Sampling Designs for Nearshore Monitoring" (Gulf Ecosystem Monitoring and Research Project).  Provides a comprehensive historical perspective of locations and types of past studies conducted in the nearshore marine communities within Gulf of Alaska in the form of a geographical information system database.</purpose>
