      <abstract>Gastrointestinal tract contents were evaluated from 73 female and juvenile
        male northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) for analysis of their diet in the
        Bering Sea. Fur seals were collected from August to October of 1981,
        1982, and 1985. Juvenile walleye Pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) and
        gonatid squid were the primary prey. Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) and
        capelin (Mallotus villosus), considered important fur seal prey in previous
        reports, were absent from the diet. Prey species and size varied among years
        and between nearshore and pelagic sample locations. Interannual variation in
        the importance of Pollock in the diet of fur seals was positively related to
        year-class strength of Pollock. Midwater (n=23) and bottom (n=116) trawls
        were conducted at the location of fur seal collections to determine availability
        of fish and squid relative to prey species eaten by fur seals. The species and
        size composition of prey taken by fur seals was similar to midwater trawl
        collections, but differed from bottom trawl catches. Contrary to earlier
        conclusions that northern fur seals are opportunistic in their feeding habits, we
        conclude that fur seals are size-selective midwater feeders during the summer
        and fall in the eastern Bering Sea.</abstract>
