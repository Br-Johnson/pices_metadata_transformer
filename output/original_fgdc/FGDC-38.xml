      <abstract>Daily fields obtained from a 17-yr atmospheric GCM simulation are used to
     study the surface sensible and latent heat flux variability and its relationship to the
     sea level pressure (SLP) field. The fluxes are analyzed over the North Pacific and
     Atlantic Oceans during winter. The leading mode of interannual SLP variability
     consists of a single center associated with the Aleutian low in the Pacific, and a
     dipole pattern associated with the Icelandic low and Azores high in the Atlantic.
     The surface flux anomalies are organized by the low-level atmospheric circulation
     associated with these modes in agreement with previous observational studies.

       The surface flux variability on all of the timescales examined, including
     intraseasonal, interannual, 3ﾖ10 day, and 10ﾖ30 day, is maximized along the
     north and west edges of both oceans and between Japan and the date line at
        35°N in the Pacific. The intraseasonal variability is approximately 3ﾖ5 times
     larger than the interannual variability, with more than half of the total surface flux
     variability occurring on timescales of less than 1 month. Surface flux variability in
     the 3ﾖ10-day band is clearly associated with midlatitude synoptic storms.
     Composites indicate upward (downward) flux anomalies that exceed |30 W
     m2| occur to the west (east) of storms, which move eastward across the oceans
     at 10°ﾖ15° per day. The SLP and surface flux anomalies are also strong and
     coherent in the 10ﾖ30-day band but are located farther north, are broader in
     scale, and propagate 3ﾖ4 times more slowly eastward than the synoptic
     disturbances.

       The sensible and latent heat flux are proportional to the wind speed multiplied
     by the airﾖsea temperature and humidity difference, respectively. The anomalous
     wind speed has the greatest influence on surface flux anomalies in the subtropics
     and western Pacific, while the air temperature and moisture anomalies have the
     greatest impact in the northeast Pacific and north of 40°N in the Atlantic. The
     covariance between the wind speed and the air temperature or humidity
     anomalies, while generally small, is non-negligible on synoptic timescales.</abstract>
