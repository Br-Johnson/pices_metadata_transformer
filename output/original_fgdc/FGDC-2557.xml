        <p>These analyses and forecasts are from the National Meteorological Center (NMC) and are archived at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).</p>
        <p>The data consist of temperature, tropopause temperature and pressure, maximum and minimum temperature, geopotential height, sea level pressure, relative humidity, wind (u and v component), vertical velocity, snow depth, sea surface temperature, and total precipitation. Temperature and geopotential height are given for 14 levels from 1000 to 10 mb, while the humidity is given as an average for the three layers; 1002-900, 1000-666, and 666-333 mb.  Vertical velocity is given at the 850, 500, and 200 mb levels. The winds analyses are given from 850 to 100 mb. Snow depth and sea surface temperature are given at the surface.</p>
        <p>The tropical analyses include temperature and winds from 850 to 200 mb.  The Northern Hemisphere forecasts include 72-hour geopotential heights from 1000 to 300 mb; 12-hour temperature at 850, 500, and 300 mb; 36-hour vertical velocity at 500 mb; 12-hour winds (u and v) at 850, 500, and 300; and 36-hour total precipitation at the surface.</p>
        <p>These analyses are prepared on a 47 X 51 (1,977 grid points) Northern Hemisphere polar stereographic octagonal grid and has a resolution of 381 km at 60 degrees North.  Latitudes south of 12 degrees North are omitted, as are the corners of the rectangle.</p>
        <p>These analyses are also prepared on a 65 X 65 (4,225 grid points) full Northern Hemisphere grid. It has the same spacing as the 1,977-point octagonal grid but it is square and extends to the equator where the resolution is 204.2 km.</p>
