        <p>The Wakatake maru (666 gross tons) departed Kushiro on June 8, 2002 and returned on July 21, 2002. There were 28 experimental fishing stations during the cruise. Nineteen fishing stations were located in the vicinity of 180º longitude from 41ºN to 58º30ﾒN latitude, and nine operations were conducted in the international waters of the central Bering Sea.</p>
        <p>The brain, pituitary, gonad, liver, head kidney and blood samples of chum salmon were collected for (1) molecular endocrine analysis of the spawning migration, including roles of salmon gonadotropin-releasing hormone (sGnRH) and (2) analysis of endocrinological changes of the fish during spawning migration from the Bering Sea to Japan. Fish caught in a healthy condition were placed in a recovery tank soon after detachment from a longline hook. After removal from the tank, chum salmon length and weight was measured and a scale collected. Blood samples were collected from the caudal vasculature and centrifuged to obtain plasma samples for analyzing levels of steroid hormones. Blood clot samples were collected for determination of haplotypes based on the sequences of mitochondrial DNA. These samples were stored at 20°C. Fish were killed by decapitation, and the gonad and liver were dissected out and weighed to calculate gonadsomatic index (GSI, gonad weight/body weight x 100) and hepatosomatic index (HSI, liver weight/body weight x 100). The brain and pituitary were hemisected and frozen in liquid nitrogen for determination of the level of mRNAs encoding hypothalamic hormones and pituitary hormones. The brain of some fish was divided into six parts (olfactory bulb, telencepharon, optic tectum, hypothalamus, cerebellum, and medulla oblongata) to determine the amount of GnRH (sGnRH and cGnRH-II) and gonadotropin (GTH Iand GTH II) contents in specific areas of the brain. Several parts of the gonads, liver and head kidneys were frozen in liquid nitrogen to measure contents of GnRH and GTH, to determine levels of mRNA encoding insulin-like growth factor I , and levels of levels of steroid hormones, respectively. Additional samples of the gonads were fixed in Bouin's solution and stored in 70% ethanol for histological analyses. In addition to the brain and pituitary samples, olfactory neurone and olfactory epithelium of some chum were collected to investigate genes related to the homing migration. All the brain, pituitary, and olfactory samples were stored at 50°C.</p>
        <p>Brain and pituitary samples were collected from total 179 chum salmon at twenty-four stations (St. 05  28). Olfactory neurone and epithelium were collected from 46 chum salmon at St. 06 - 14 in the North Pacific Ocean and three stations in the Bering Sea. Gonad, blood and liver samples were collected from 102 (gonad and blood) and 92 chum salmon (liver) at 20 and 17 fishing stations, respectively.</p>
        <p>In the central North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea, six round samples of salmon which might be a hybrid between chum and pink salmon, and extremely slim (skinny) fish were collected.  In addition, three skinny chum salmon were collected as round samples for lipid analysis and evaluation of body condition</p>
