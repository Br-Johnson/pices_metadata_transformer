        <p>The authors spent about 65 person-days preparing a report on the birds of the eastern Bering Sea under a subcontract to OCSEAP RU-77 (Ecosystem Dynamics-Birds and Mammals) The pertinent literature was reviewed on ten species of marine birds which are important in that are either because of their large biomass, or as representatives of the diversity of the pelagic bird community.  Dramatic seasonal changes occur in the abundance of birds influx of Sooty and short-tailed Shearwaters form their breeding grounds in the southern hemisphere and with the staging of Alaskan breeding species prior to nesting.</p>
        <p>This final report provides data on murres and shearwaters in the Bering Sea, integrates essential information from the preliminary reports and attempts to present a general background pictures of marine birds in the eastern Bering Sea and factors pertinent to their feeding ecology.  It also summarizes information and biological concepts important to a basic understanding of the role of birds in the ecosystem of the eastern Bering Sea.</p>
        <p>This report replaces: Part II, Food Web Structures and Trophic Relations of Bering Sea Avifauna (Preliminary Report) September 1976".</p>
