      <abstract>Incipient marine cyclogenesis is investigated as an instability process of a mean
     baroclinic state with a vertically nonuniform static stability under the influence of a
     self-induced surface sensible heat flux in the context of a quasigeostrophic model
     framework. The analytic solution of such a model is first presented. The surface
     sensible heat flux induces strongly unstable short waves in the meso- range and
     an e-folding time of the order of one day under supposedly relevant parameter
     conditions. Those modes have a shallow vertical structure near the surface with a
     pronounced westward tilt with height. The latter facilitates a release of enough
     potential energy from the basic state to overcompensate the destruction of
     potential energy by the surface heat exchange itself. The diabatic destabilization
     by surface sensible heat flux is therefore an alternative mechanism for initiating
     small marine cyclones without upper-level forcing.

       A potential vorticity interpretation of this instability process is also given. A
     supplementary numerical analysis confirms that the meso- unstable waves are
     robust because they exist when various combinations of low-level static stability
     and heating profiles are used. The dependence upon the heating profile is
     somewhat stronger, capable of inducing an additional set of unstable modes
     between the meso- and synoptic-scale ranges when it increases substantially
     with height near the surface.</abstract>
