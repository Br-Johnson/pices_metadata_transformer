      <abstract>Populations and productivity of seabirds were monitored at two colonies in
     the Bering Sea, Cape Peirce and Bluff, and at Cape Thompson, in the
     Chukchi Sea. Murres and kittiwakes were monitored at all three colonies to
     facilitate intercolony comparisons. These species were selected because they
     are relatively easy to study, numerous, sensitive to potential impacts of
     development, and widely distributed. Monitoring methods were standardized
     among the three colonies to facilitate comparisons among colonies and year.
     Populations and productivity were monitored in a portion of each colony, on
     permanent plots that were delineated on photographs and viewed from the top
     of the cliff. Observations of productivity began at the time nests were
     established and continued until most young had fledged. Kittiwake nests and
     murre breeding sites used for estimation of productivity were mapped on
     photographs or sketches and the fate of each was recorded.</abstract>
