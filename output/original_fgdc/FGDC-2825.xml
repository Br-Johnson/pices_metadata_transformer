      <abstract>Consumption of walleye Pollock Theragra chalcogramma and Pacific herring
     Clupea pallasii by Groundfish predators in the eastern Bering Sea was
     quantified and described using data obtained in 1985-88. Groundfish
     predators considered here include walleye Pollock Theragra chalcogramma;
     Pacific cod Gadus macrocephalus; yellowfin sole Pleuronectes asper; flathead
     sole Hippoglossoides elassodon; rock sole Pleuronectes bilineatus; Alaska
     plaice Pleuronectes quadrituberculatus; arrowtooth flounder Atheresthes
     stomias; and Greenland turbot Reinhardtius hippoglossoides. Marine mammal
     and bird consumption of Pollock and herring was estimated for 1985 and
     compared with Groundfish consumption. Groundfish predation on Pollock
     during this time period was dominated by cannibalism on age-0 Pollock by
     adult Pollock. The highest predation rate occurred in 1985 when the largest
     Pollock year class, as assessed at age 1, during the time period was
     produced. Predation mortality estimates by age on the 1985 year class were
     higher than adjacent year classes. Apparently, predators responded to the
     increased abundance of the 1985 Pollock year class by switching to predation
     on that year class. The impact of this predation appeared to dampen the size
     of the 1985 year class at age 3 relative to other adjacent year classes. Marine
     mammal and bird predation on Pollock was small relative to Pollock
     cannibalism. However, marine mammal predation on older Pollock was more
     important, almost doubling the estimated predation mortality rate of age-2 fish.
     Herring consumption by Groundfish predators tended to be sporadic in time
     and space and may have depended on encounter rates of herring schools
     rather than overall biomass. Pacific cod was the most consistent Groundfish
     predator on herring.</abstract>
