        <p>An article in the Audubon (July - August 1991) showing the unity and findings of "US and Soviet Environmentalists Join Forces across the Bering Sea", it's history and results.</p>
        <p>
          A cold wind, blowing off the retreating pack ice in the Bering Sea, sent the snow swirling around the visitors on the cliffs at St. Paul Island, Alaska.  In summer those cliffs are home to huge, tumultuous colonies of seabirds.  Now, with the land still in the icy grip of early spring and barren of birds, one of the group pointed to the rusting hulk of a boat flung up by the sea on the rocks below.  The name
          <I>Terminator</I>
          was clearly visible on its hull.
        </p>
        <p>"Seven fishing boats, mostly crabbers, were wrecked on the island in recent years and left to rot," Ilarion (Larry) Merculieff, the city manager of St. Paul (population 763) in the Pribilof Islands, told his visitors.  "Our people risked their lives to save the crews.  Nobody will salvage the boats, so they lie there, leaking fuel into the sea.  Offshore, behind the falling snow, are more boatscrabbers like this one and big factory shipssucking up the fish that Aleuts and all the wildlife here depend on."</p>
