      <abstract>Oil and gas drilling programs in the Alaska Chukchi Sea were carried out on
     leases offshore from Kasegaluk Lagoon in 1989-91, and further exploration
     and development activities in this area are likely in future years. We conducted
     aerial surveys between late July and early September 1989-91 to determine
     the distribution and abundance of marine birds in the Kasegaluk Lagoon area.
     We hypothesized that Kasegaluk Lagoon supported an avifauna similar to that
     found in other lagoon systems in arctic Alaska. In fact, the richness and
     diversity of bird species using Kasegaluk Lagoon were greater than in lagoon
     systems in the Beaufort Sea. Brant (Branta bernicla) was the most abundant
     species in Kasegaluk Lagoon compared to lagoons in the Beaufort Sea,
     where the Oldsquaw (Clangula hyemalis) is the dominant species. Several
     other species or species groups, such as Glaucous Gull (Larus hyperboreus),
     Arctic Tern (Sterna paradisaea), small shorebirds (mainly Calidris and
     Phalaropus), and Lesser Snow Goose (Chen caerulescens) were also
     relatively abundant in Kasegaluk Lagoon.</abstract>
