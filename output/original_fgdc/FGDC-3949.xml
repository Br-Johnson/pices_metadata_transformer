        <p>Daily sea surface temperature (SST) data analysis by Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA).</p>
        <p>JMA started, in March 1996, daily high resolution SST analysis for the region between 20째N and 50째N and between 120째E and 160째E. The resolution is a quarter degree.</p>
        <p>An optimal interpolation method is employed and the first guess field is given by linearly interpolating the climatological SST data of every one degree that JMA produced. The parameters used in the optimal interpolation are determined by examining the statistical characteristics of observations.</p>
        <p>The analysis uses sea surface observation by NOAA and the in situ observation by ships and buoys. The data from the ships which make reports with bias or standard error larger than that of typical observation vessels are excluded from the process. The all the in-situ data within the spacial and temporal box of 1 day * 0.25 degree * 0.25 degree are averaged to give a representative value for that box, and these representative values are fed to the optimal interpolation as the 'observations'.</p>
        <p>To get the interpolated value at each of the grind points, the 'observations' for the past 5 days within a half of the the typical spacial scale of the variation for the points are used. The typical spacial scale of the variation is estimated by examining the NOAA SST and varies from 40 km to 400km. In practice, in order to ensure that the interpolation is made with a sufficient number of input data, the minimum scale is set to be 200 km.</p>
        <p>Data sets may be obtained directly from the North-East Asian Regional - Global Ocean Observing System (NEAR-GOOS) Regional Delayed Mode Data Base (RDMDB) at http://near-goos1.jodc.go.jp/ with a user account.  First time users must register to gain database access.</p>
