      <abstract>This report is a collection of papers resulting from northern fur seal
                        (Callorhinus ursinus) research conducted by the National Marine
                        Mammal Laboratory in 1992 on the Pribilof Islands (10 July - 1
                        September) in the Bering Sea, and San Miguel Island (20 May - 1
                        November) off southern California.

                        Since 1991, harem bull counts increased 15.5% and 39.8% on St.
                        Paul and St. George Islands, respectively. The total number of
                        pups born on St. Paul Island (182,468 ± 19,263) was estimated
                        from shear sampling surveys conducted during 17 August -1
                        September and was not significantly different from the 1989 and
                        1990 estimates. The total number of pups born on St. George
                        Island (25,160 ± 1,730) was estimated from surveys conducted
                        during 14-17 August and was not significantly different from the
                        1990 estimates.

                        A tagging project was initiated in 1987 to examine variability in
                        population dynamics. The 1992 studies based on this tagged
                        population support past findings that there is a tendency for males
                        to be resighted near their natal rookery; that the date of first
                        sighting is significantly related to age (P &lt; 0.001) (older males
                        arrive earlier in the season than younger ones); and a significant
                        relationship exists between male pup weight and weight at age 2
                        (P = 0.001, n = 20) and age 3 (P = 0.006, n = 81), but not at 
                        age 4 (P = 0.07, n = 78) or age 5 (P = 0.18, n = 15).

                        The estimated incidence of entanglement in net debris among
                        female fur seals on St. Paul Island was 0.062% for 1991 and
                        0.036% for 1992 with a 2-year mean of 0.046%. This is a
                        reduced level of entanglement compared with a similar study in
                        1985 which showed entanglement rates of 0.06%-0.23% and a
                        mean of 0.14%. The proportion of juvenile males observed
                        entangled in 1992 was 0.29%. The frequency of occurrence of
                        trawl webbing among entangling debris in 1992 was about
                        one-half that observed prior to 1988. The proportion of seals
                        entangled in other types of debris did not change. The 1992
                        studies on male entanglement confirm earlier estimates that the
                        annual survival of seals entangled in small debris is about one-half
                        that of nonentangled seals. Seals from which debris was removed
                        had significantly (P &lt; .05) higher survival rates than those which
                        remained entangled.

                        The maximum number of territorial bulls on San Miguel Island was
                        72 on 8 July. Live pup counts on 29 July and 5 August totaled
                        1,124 and 965, respectively. on 11 August, 274 dead pups were
                        counted. One hundred and fifty pups were tagged on 27
                        September and another 150 were tagged on 1 November. Mean
                        pup weights for 1992 were significantly lower (P &lt;0.001) than
                        mean pup weights for all non-El Ni￱o years between 1977 and
                        1991, but significantly greater (P &lt; 0.001) than those of the         
                        El Ni￱o years of 1976 and 1983. This indicates that while the
                        health of preweaned pups was compromised during the
                        1991-1992 El Ni￱o, it was not as detrimental as previous warm
                        water events.</abstract>
