      <abstract>A cooperative bottom trawl survey of the Bering Sea was
                        conducted by the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) of the
                        United States and the Pacific Research Institute of Fisheries and
                        Oceanography of the U.S.S.R. aboard the Soviet research vessel
                        Novodrutsk during May-June 1991. The primary purpose of this
                        survey was to assess the distribution, abundance, and biological
                        condition of Groundfish resources over the continental shelf in both
                        the eastern and western Bering Sea. An independent bottom trawl
                        survey of the central and southeastern Bering Sea continental shelf
                        was also conducted by the AFSC during June-September 1991
                        aboard U.S. research vessels.

                        Results summarizing geographic distribution, abundance estimates,
                        and size composition are presented for the principal species of fish
                        encountered. The distributions of commercially important crab
                        species are also shown. Comparisons are made among results of
                        this cooperative survey, the 1991 U.S. survey, and earlier surveys
                        from the areas commonly fished in the eastern Bering Sea. The
                        appendices include station and catch information, abundance, size,
                        and age data.</abstract>
