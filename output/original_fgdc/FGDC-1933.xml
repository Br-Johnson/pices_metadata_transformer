      <abstract>The BASS Workshop on "The development of a conceptual model of the Subarctic Pacific basin exosystem" discusses the possibility of applying ECOPATH/ECOSIM to the modeling of subarctic gyre ecosystems, based on presentations, the extended abstracts of which appear in the report.  The initial eastern- and western- subarctic gyre ecosystem models were reviewed and existing data used for each model were ntoed.  

The MODEL Workshop on "Strategies for coupling higher and lower trophic level marine ecosystem models" discussed the strategic considerations necessary in coupling higher and lower trophic level marine ecosystem models and the extension and improvement of the prototype lower trophic level PICES NEMURO Model. The workshop report contains abstracts, extended abstracts, and fully prepared reports presented at the workshop.  

The MONITOR Workshop on "Progress in monitoring the North Pacific" reviewed ongoing and/or planned monitoring programs in North Pacific and made a number of pertinent recommendations. The summary of the workshop is followed by extended abstracts of papers given at the meeting.  

The REX Workshop on "Trends in herring populations and trophodynamics" summarized generalizations, observations and hypotheses on herring populations and identified the need to add F (fish) into the current crop of NPZ (Nutrients - Phytoplankton - Zooplankton) models that are available.
