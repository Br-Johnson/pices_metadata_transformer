      <abstract>A progradational regime of falling sea level and/or high sediment input has
     produced extensive beach ridge plains in northwest Alaska during the last
     4000 yr. Eleven Chukchi Sea beach ridge complexes, oriented at various
     angles to wind fetch, provide a cumulative history of longshore transport and
     erosion. Archaeological and geological upper limiting radiocarbon ages (n =
     59) allow correlation between depositional units on seven beach ridge
     complexes. Progradation started 4000 yr B.P. at nearly all complexes, as
     ecstatic sea level stabilized. Two disconformities or truncations are found on
     most of the complexes, providing time-parallel storm horizons, dated at
     3300-1700 and 1200-900 super(14)C yr B.P. Between 1700 and 1200
     super(14)C yr B.P. most of the complexes prograded, indicating the
     predominance of less-stormy conditions. Modern synoptic patterns that
     produce Chukchi beach ridge erosion are linked to northerly shifts in North
     Pacific storm tracks. The regionwide beach ridge Erosional truncations
     correlate with records of glacier expansion, heightened precipitation evident in
     tree-rings, stream flooding, and shelf deposits reworked by storm surges.</abstract>
