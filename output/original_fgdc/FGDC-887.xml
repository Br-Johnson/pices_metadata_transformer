        <p>During July and September 1999, the Auke Bay Laboratory conducted surveys of juvenile salmon distribution, migration, and growth along the coastal waters of the eastern Bering Sea. The 1999 surveys were the first in a series of annual assessments to document variations in the biological characteristics (growth, migration, and distribution) of juvenile sockeye salmon leaving Bristol Bay.</p>
        <p>
          Coastal surveys of the eastern Bering Sea were conducted during July 12 to 26 and September 2 to 12, 1999. The survey area was bounded to the west by Cape Cheerful (off of Unalaska Island) and to the east by the Egegik River in Bristol Bay. Transects sampled during the surveys were perpendicular to the coast and generally 55 to 110 km apart. Sampling at each transect began near the coast then continued offshore with stations every 18.5 km to at least 110 km or further if large catches of juvenile sockeye salmon occurred at offshore stations. Both surveys were conducted aboard the contracted fishing vessel (F/V)

        <p>Fish samples were collected using a midwater rope trawl. Salmon and other fishes were sorted by species and counted. Standard biological measurements including fork length, body weight, and sex as well as scale samples from the preferred area (to document age and growth) were taken from subsamples of all salmon species. Oceanographic data were also collected at each trawl station immediately prior to each trawl haul. Depth profiles of salinity and temperature from surface to near bottom depths at each trawl station were collected using a Sea-Bird SBE 19 Seacat profiler. During July, plankton samples were collected at each trawl station using 60- and 20-cm diameter bongo samplers fitted with 333- and 153 Âµm mesh nets, respectively.</p>

      <purpose>The primary goal of the annual assessments is to establish and verify the linkages between adult sockeye salmon survival and annual variations in biological characteristics of juvenile sockeye salmon. Eastern Bering Sea research cruises were conducted by the Auke Bay Laboratory Ocean Carrying Capacity program during July and September 1999 to study the early marine distribution, migration, and growth of juvenile Bristol Bay sockeye salmon.</purpose>
