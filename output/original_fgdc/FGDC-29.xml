      <abstract>The global distributions of the airﾖsea fluxes of heat and freshwater and water
     mass transformation rates from a control integration of the coupled National
     Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Climate System Model (CSM) are
     compared with similar fields from an uncoupled ocean model equilibrium spinup
     and a new surface Climatology. The Climatology and uncoupled model use the
     same bulk-flux forcing scheme and are forced with National Centers for
     Environmental Prediction (formerly the National Meteorological Center)
     atmospheric reanalysis data and satellite-based cloud cover, solar flux, and
     precipitation estimates. The climatological fluxes for the open ocean are adjusted
     to give a global net balance and are in broad general agreement with standard
     ship-based estimates. An exception is the ice-free Southern Ocean, where the net
     heat and evaporative fluxes appear to be too weak but where the observational
     coverage underlying the reanalyze is quite poor. Major differences are observed
     between the Climatology and the NCAR CSM coupled solution, namely,
     enhanced tropical and subtropic solar insulation, stronger energy and hydrologic
     cycles, and excessive high-latitude ice formation/melt producing a several-fold
     increase in Arctic and Antarctic deep water formation through brine rejection. The
     anomalous fluxes and corresponding water-mass transformations are closely tied
     to the coupled ocean model drift, characterized by a reorganization of the vertical
     salinity distribution. Some error features in the heat flux and sea surface
     temperature fields are common to both the coupled and uncoupled solutions,
     primarily in the western boundary currents and the Antarctic circumpolar current,
     and are thus likely due to the poor representation of the circulation field in the
     coarse-resolution NCAR ocean model. Other problems particular to the
     uncoupled spinup are related to the bulk-flux forcing scheme, an example being
     excess freshwater deposition in the western boundary currents arising from the
     inclusion of a weak open ocean surface salinity restoring term. The effective
     thermal restoring coefficient, which relates the change in nonsolar surface heat flux
     to sea surface temperature changes, is on average 14.6 W m2 K1 for the
     coupled solution or about a third of the range from the bulk flux forcing scheme,
     40ﾖ60 W m2 K1.</abstract>
