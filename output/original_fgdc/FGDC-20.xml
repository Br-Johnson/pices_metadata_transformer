      <abstract>In the fall of 1994, the Beaufort and Arctic Storms Experiment (BASE) was
     held to collect information on the structure and evolution of mesoscale weather
     systems over the southern Beaufort Sea and the Mackenzie River delta of the
     western Canadian Arctic. As part of the experiment, X-band Doppler radar
     observations were carried out at Tuktoyaktuk, a village on the shore of the
     Beaufort Sea. In this paper, the precipitation features, structure, and moisture
     transport associated with two distinctly different weather systems that were
     observed during BASE are described with a variety of datasets. Climatologies of
     storm activity in the area suggest these two types of different weather systems, the
     so-called Pacific origin and storm track disturbances, are the most frequently
     observed in this region during the fall months.

       The characteristic feature of a Pacific origin weather system is a pronounced
     layering of the air masses. In the upper layer, the air mass is of Pacific origin and is
     associated with a deep low in the Gulf of Alaska. As a result it is moist and is
     capable of producing precipitation. In contrast, the lower layer is initially of
     continental origin and is associated with a secondary lee cyclogenesis event in the
     Mackenzie River basin. As the secondary disturbance moves to the east, there is
     a shift in the wind direction that advects air from the Beaufort Sea into the lower
     layer. This results in a moistening of the lower layer that allows precipitation from
     the upper layer that had previously evaporated in the lower layer to be enhanced
     and reach the surface. The detailed structure of this type of storm is strongly
     affected by the topography of the region and the presence of open water in the
     southern Beaufort Sea.

       The storm track weather system is markedly different and is associated with the
     passage of a mesoscale low over the southern Beaufort Sea. In this sort of
     system, there is a well-defined frontal structure of a type previously identified in
     the midlatitudes. Two different precipitation regimes are identified that are
     associated with the passage of the warm and cold front. In this sort of system, the
     sources of moisture are the Bering Sea and the open water in the southern
     Beaufort Sea.</abstract>
