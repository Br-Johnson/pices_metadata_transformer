      <abstract>A free-drift sea-ice model for advection is described which includes an interactive wind-driven ocean for closure. A reduced system of equations is solved economically by a simple iteration on the water stress. The performance of the model is examined through a sensitivity study considering ice thickness, Ekman-layer scaling, wind speed, and drag coefficients. A case study is also presented where the model is driven by measured winds and the resulting drift rate compared to measured ice-drift rate for a three-day period during March 1981 at about 80 km inside the boundary of the open pack ice in the Bering Sea. The advective model is shown to be sensitive to certain assumptions. Increasing the scaling parameter A for the Ekman depth in the ocean model from 0.3 to 0.4 causes a 10 to 15% reduction in ice speed but only a slight decrease in rotation angle () with respect to the wind. Modeled  is strongly a function of ice thickness, while speed is not very sensitive to thickness. Ice speed is sensitive to assumptions about drag coefficients for the upper (C) and lower (C) surfaces of the ice. Specifying C and the ratio of C to C are important to the calculations.</abstract>
