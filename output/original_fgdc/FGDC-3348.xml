      <abstract>This report references population abundance data of algal communities, invertebrate communities, invertebrate species: Dermasterias imbricata, Macoma spp., Siliqua patula, and Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis, nearshore bird communities, and sea otters (Enhydra lutris); production data of algal and invertebrate communities; and species composition data of algal communities, algal species: Alaria spp., Fucus distichus, Laminaria spp., and Nereocystis luetkeana, fish species (Nereocystis luetkeana), harlequin ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus), invertebrate communities, invertebrate species: Dermasterias imbricata, Littorina spp., Macoma spp., Mytilus trossulus, Protothaca staminea, Saxidomus giganteus, Siliqua patula, Spisula spp., and Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis, and nearshore bird and fish communities; and temperature data of air and water from Middleton Island, Cook Inlet and Yakutat, Gulf of Alaska.

  The aforementioned data are referenced in citation: Palmisano, J.F.  1976.  Results of a seasonal study of the accumulation of drift zone biota in the eastern Gulf of Alaska, July 1975 - June 1976.

  This literature was collected as part of a metadatabase that represents one or more nearshore resources (from physical attributes such as water and air, to birds and mammals).  Each entry is viewable in three formats, 1) a geospatial explicit format (ArcView 3.3) named GIS ArcView 3.3 Near GEM project, 2) a spreadsheet format (Excel 2002 and within ArcView) named GEM Nearshore Metadata Set, and 3) a ProCite database named GEM Nearshore Metadata References, which consists of references included in 1 and 2 above.  The ProCite database record number corresponds to the Excel Procite Number.  Reference Procite #761 for this literature's metadata.

  The metadata are maintained in digital format (ArcView 3.3, Excel 2002, and Procite) and are available from the Alaska Science Center, USGS in Anchorage, Alaska.

  For a detailed description of the three databases and the project, see "Bodkin, J. L., and T. Dean.  2003.  Alternative Sampling Designs for Nearshore Monitoring (Gulf Ecosystem Monitoring and Research Project G-030687), US Geological Survey, Alaska Science Center, Anchorage, Alaska." available on-line at http://www.evostc.state.ak.us/pdf/GEM_final_reports/030687.pdf.</abstract>
      <purpose>Part of the design effort of the "Alternative Sampling Designs for Nearshore Monitoring" (Gulf Ecosystem Monitoring and Research Project).  Provides a comprehensive historical perspective of locations and types of past studies conducted in the nearshore marine communities within Gulf of Alaska in the form of a geographical information system database.</purpose>
