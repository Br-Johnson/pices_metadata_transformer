      <abstract>The goal of this research is to understand factors affecting salmon stock dynamics in the Subarctic Pacific and its marginal seas, identified as a central issue by the North
Pacific Marine Research program. The approach is a retrospective study of growth and survival of chum and pink salmon stocks from diverse locations including western Alaska. The operating hypothesis is that, because fluctuating ocean climate differs from
west to east in the historical record, salmon productivity (growth and survival) should also have varied concordantly, both in historical and spatial scales. Over thirty years of data suitable for testing this hypothesis and alternatives are available in archives of
production statistics and scales. The method will entail retrospective time series analyses of salmon production and climate variation and will entail an analysis of spatial patterns of salmon production. Through this analysis we expect to identify factors affecting growth and survival of salmon from different parts of their range across the Subarctic Pacific.
