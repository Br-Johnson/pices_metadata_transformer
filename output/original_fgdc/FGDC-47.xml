      <abstract>A dynamic-thermodynamic sea ice model is developed and coupled with
     the Melbourne University general circulation model to simulate the seasonal
     cycle of the Antarctic sea ice distribution. The model is efficient, rapid to
     compute, and useful for a range of climate studies. The thermodynamic part
     of the sea ice model is similar to that developed by Parkinson and
     Washington, the dynamics contain a simplified ice rheology that resists
     compression. The thermodynamics is based on energy conservation at the top
     surface of the ice/snow, the ice/water interface, and the open water area to
     determine the ice formation, accretion, and ablation. A lead parameterization
     is introduced with an effective partitioning scheme for freezing between and
     under the ice floes. The dynamic calculation determines the motion of ice,
     which is forced with the atmospheric wind, taking account of ice resistance
     and rafting. The simulated sea ice distribution compares reasonably well with
     observations. The seasonal cycle of ice extent is well simulated in phase as
     well as in magnitude. Simulated sea ice thickness and concentration are also
     in good agreement with observations over most regions and serve to indicate
     the importance of advection and ocean drift in the determination of the sea ice
     distribution.</abstract>
