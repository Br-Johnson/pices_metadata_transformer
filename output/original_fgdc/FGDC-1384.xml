        <p>The Bering Sea Resource Assessment group completed its annual shelf crab-groundfish bottom trawl survey during 29 May - 1 August 2002.  This yearï¾’s survey was performed aboard the chartered fishing vessels Arcturus and Aldebaran.  This marks the 10th consecutive survey using these vessels.</p>
        <p>A total of 393 stations were sampled, including 18 special stations from inner Bristol Bay, to continue our evaluation of yellowfin sole spawning populations during the sampling period.  Abundance estimates for the major species showed few unexpected changes from 2001.</p>
        <p>Seawater temperature profiles were collected at most sampling sites using a micro-bathythermograph attached to the headrope of the net. Surface seawater temperatures were also collected with a bucket thermometer. Sampling was carried out in the Pribilof Islands and St. Matthew Island regions to collect additional data on crab populations. Additional stations north of the standard survey area were established to estimate the abundance of Tanner crab (C. opilio) in that area.</p>
        <p>Biological data were collected at alternate north/south columns of stations proceeding from Bristol Bay westward to the shelf edge. All catches were sorted to the lowest possible taxon, weighed, and enumerated. Station data including time, position, trawl performance, distance fished as well as catch information was entered onto diskettes with shipboard computer systems. Age samples (by sex-centimeter category), size composition, and other biological data were collected from the major fish species  encountered. Length-width measurements, shell condition, clutch size, and tissues and organs for various studies were collected from the major crab species. Special study collections were stored in appropriate fixatives or were frozen.</p>
