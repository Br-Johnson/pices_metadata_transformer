      <abstract>This report assesses the status of the coastal Pacific whiting
                        (Merluccius productus) resource in 1993. It reviews recent
                        developments in the Pacific whiting fishery, tabulates and analyzes
                        the 1992 catch statistics, reports on the 1992 triennial
                        acoustic/midwater trawl and bottom trawl surveys of Pacific
                        whiting, describes a stock synthesis model application using catch
                        and survey data from 1965 to 1992, and presents yield options for
                        1994-96. The U.S. and Canadian harvest of Pacific whiting in
                        1992 was 295,189 metric tons (t). In 1993, the yield is expected
                        to be 203,000 t. Assessment surveys conducted during summer of
                        1992 by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and the
                        Canada Department of Fisheries and Oceans resulted in estimates
                        of population abundance considerably in excess of forecasts based
                        on earlier surveys and models. Population biomass was estimated
                        by the coastwide NMFS acoustic survey as 2.557 million t, more
                        than double the acoustic estimate of 1.264 million t in 1989. The
                        1992 acoustic survey was conducted with a new echo-integration
                        system and had a wider areal coverage than previous assessments.
                        However, the population biomass estimates made with the new
                        system still depend on the acoustic target strength of Pacific
                        whiting, which continues to have a large amount of uncertainty
                        associated with it. A geographic version of the stock synthesis
                        model that divided the population into U.S. and Canadian
                        components was used to assess the Pacific whiting population.
                        Population biomass peaked in 1987 and has been declining
                        steadily since that time. The biomass of age 3 and older fish in
                        1992 was estimated to be 3,055 million t. The recruitment
                        abundance of the 1989 and 1990 year classes were estimated at
                        0.233 and 1.999 billion fish respectively, indicating that the 1989
                        year class is a weak year class, while the 1990 year class is close
                        to the average 1977-92 recruitment of 2.170 billion age-2 fish.
                        Indications from the 1992 assessment surveys and preliminary
                        data from the 1993 fishery are that the 1991 year class is also
                        average in size. The effect of uncertainty in the acoustic target
                        strength estimate was examined by comparing stock synthesis runs
                        using a target strength of -35 dB/kg (the standard value) and a
                        more conservative target strength of -33.5 dB/kg. The estimated
                        1992 biomass for a target strength of -33.5 dB/kg is 2.317  
                        million t, 25% lower than the estimated biomass for a -35 dB/kg
                        model. Recruitment estimates and fishery selectivity coefficients
                        from the stock synthesis model were used with an age-structured
                        simulation model to estimate sustainable yield. A deterministic
                        version of the model was used to forecast yields for 1994-96.
                        Several harvesting strategies are presented: a constant F strategy,
                        a variable F strategy (where fishing mortality for a particular year is
                        proportional to the level of female spawning biomass), and a
                        hybrid strategy that combines features of the other two policies.
                        Three harvest rates are presented for each harvest strategy. These
                        harvest rates are set based on the probability that female spawning
                        biomass will fall below a cautionary level of 623,000 t in long-term
                        simulations of the Pacific whiting population. When a hybrid fishing
                        strategy is applied to the projected numbers at age in 1994, the
                        potential total yield is calculated to be 325,000 t at a low harvest
                        rate, 450,000 t at a moderate harvest rate, and 555,000 t at a high
                        harvest rate. The dependence of our recommendations on one
                        acoustic biomass estimate is an important consideration in seeing
                        short-term yields from the fishery. It seems reasonable to require
                        at least two corroborating surveys before substantially increasing
                        the potential yields for a fishery. For this reason, we recommend a
                        low harvest rate for 1994-96. If recruitment remains near the
                        1960-92 median recruitment of 0.941 billion fish, the outlook for
                        the immediate future is for a fairly rapid decline in annual yield in
                        1995 and 1996. The recruitment of a strong year class to the
                        fishery would substantially increase the projected yields.</abstract>
