      <abstract>Week-long samples of airborne particulate matter were obtained at Alert,
     Northwest Territories, Canada, between 1980 and 1991. The concentrations of
     24 particulate constituents have some strong, persistent seasonal variations that
     depend on the transport from their sources. In order to explore the nature of the
     cyclical variation of the different processes that give rise to the measured
     concentrations, the observations were arranged into both a two-way matrix and a
     three-way data array. For the latter, the three modes consist of chemical
     constituents, weeks within a year, and years. The two-way bilinear model and a
     three-way trilinear model were used to fit the data and a new data analysis
     technique, positive matrix factorization (PMF), has been used to obtain the
     solutions. PMF utilizes the error estimates of the observations to provide an
     optimal pointwise scaling data array for weighting, which enables it to handle
     missing data, a common occurrence in environmental measurements. It can also
     apply nonnegative constraints to the factors. Five factors have been obtained that
     reproduce the data quite well for both two-way and three-way analyses. Each
     factor represents a probable source with a compositional profile and distinctive
     seasonal variations. Specifically, there are (i) an acid photochemical factor typified
     by Br, H+, and SO24 and characterized by a concentration maximum around
     April, or shortly after polar sunrise; (ii) a soil factor representing by Si, Al, and Ca
     and having its main seasonal maximum in September and October; (iii) an
     anthropogenic factor dominated by SO24 together with metallic species like Pb,
     Zn, V, As, Sb, Se, In, etc., peaking from December to April; (iv) a sea salt factor
     consisting mainly of Cl, Na, and K with maximum concentrations during the
     period from October to April; and (v) a biogenic factor characterized by
     methanesulfonate and having a primary maximum at May and a secondary
     maximum in August. The results obtained by both two-way and three-way PMF
     analyses are generally consistent with one another. However, there are differences
     because of additional constraints on the solution imposed by the three-way
     analysis. The results also help to confirm the hypotheses regarding the origins of
     the Arctic aerosol.</abstract>
