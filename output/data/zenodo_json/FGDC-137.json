The primary sources were the Institute of Marine Science,  University of Alaska Fairbanks, AK; Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, Seattle, WA; Faculty of  Fisheries, Hokkaido University, Japan; National Oceanographic Data Center; and National Marine Fisheries\nService, Seattle, WA. Annual maps of bottom temperatures are available on the UAF web site.\n\n     **We found that data sets of primary production and productivity exist only intermittently over the past 30   years. We will compare our biological and environmental data with the ongoing analysis by L. J. Miller and D.  Eslinger (University of Alaska). They are conducting a comparison of satellite derived primary production with\n     in situ measurements and we will examine how they relate to environmental factors (L. J. Miller, M. S. Thesis,   University of Alaska Fairbanks).\n\n     ***daily estimates of cool season surface heat fluxes from National Center for Environmental Prediction    (NCEP) from 1946-present.\n\n     ****Fish distribution data are from Benthic trawl surveys covering the eastern and central Bering Sea shelf  from 1972 to the present.

    "notes": "Purpose: We have found that in the late 1970s, there was a regime shift, or step, in the climate of the north Pacific causing, among many other things, a 5% reduction in the ice cover in the eastern Bering Sea. Analysis of monthly mean northern hemisphere sea level pressure for winters (DJFM) for 1947-96 were compared with monthly mean ice cover from the Bering Sea for 1952-96 as well as with the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI).\nBefore the regime shift, below normal ice cover in the Bering Sea was typically associated with El Nino conditions which caused the Aleutian low to move eastward of normal, driving warm Pacific air over the Bering Sea. Conversely, above normal ice cover was associated with La Nina conditions which are accompanied by the Aleutian low moving westward of normal allowing higher pressure and colder conditions\nto move over the Bering Sea. However, since the regime shift, this correlation of ice with both the Aleutian low movement and with the SOI has reversed. Before the regime shift, the occurrence of El Nino and La Nina conditions was about even. Since the regime shift, El Nino conditions are about three times more prevalent.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: Unknown\n\nAccess constraints: None\n\nUse constraints: None\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system. NOAA makes no warranty, expressed or implied, nor does the fact of distribution constitute such a warranty.\n\nFGDC metadata date: 19990505\nFGDC metadata contact: Kimberly Bahl\nFGDC metadata standard: Content Standards for Digital Geospatial Metadata (version: FGDC-STD-001-1998)",
