    "description": "During the late summer of 1997, for the first time ever recorded, most of the continental shelf of the eastern Bering Sea\nwas covered by aquamarine waters (Figure 1) which resulted from a massive bloom of coccolithophores (Figure 2).\nReflectance of light off the calcium carbonate plates of the flagellated coccolithophores gave the water its anomalous\ncolor, which was first observed in July. The bloom was also clearly visible from space, as shown by some of the first\nimages from the multispectral SeaWiFS scanner in September. Light penetration into the water column, essential for\nprimary production by diatoms and other Phytoplankton, was markedly reduced. This shift in the dominant primary\nproducers potentially altered the trophic dynamics throughout the food web of one of world's most productive\necosystems. Prior to and during the bloom, anomalous atmospheric and oceanic conditions were evident. In July, large\nwhales were relatively abundant in the region of the middle shelf where the bloom occurred. Concomitant with the bloom\nof coccolithophores were die offs of seabirds and a decrease in the number of salmon returning to Bristol Bay. Reports of\ndie-offs of seabirds began in early August. Field operations conducted as part of the National Science Foundation's Inner\nFront project and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Coastal Ocean Program and Fisheries\nOceanography Coordinated Investigations provide a wealth of data to explore this year's anomalous conditions. \n\nThe eastern Bering Sea shelf (Figure 3) consists of domains characterized by water properties, water column structure\nand plankton dynamics. Coastal water (depth less than 50 m) is typically mixed by a combination of tidal and wind stirring.\nWater over the middle shelf (depth 50-100 m) usually has two well mixed layers: the upper a result of the annual melt of\nsea ice and/or solar heating while the lower remains cold and rich in nutrients essential for Phytoplankton growth.\nSeparating the domains is a structure or inner front which extends for over 1000 km around the shelf. The dynamics of\nthe inner front likely provide nitrogenous nutrients for the prolonged primary and secondary production which typically\noccurs there. Typical springtime Phytoplankton blooms in the Bering Sea are comprised of diatoms and are associated\nwith increased water column stratification as a result of sea-ice meltback or solar radiation. Summertime Phytoplankton\nblooms of the magnitude observed this year are rare, in part because the nutrients for plant growth are generally thought\nto be limiting. Zooplankton biomass may be enhanced two different ways: increased secondary production via increased\nfood availability for herbivorous grazers, and physical concentration of grazers due to convergence of water at the front.\nAs a result of the favorable conditions generated by this increase in prey biomass, massive flocks of seabirds return each\nyear to feed at the front and breed in Alaskan waters. \n\nA sequence of unusual phenomena occurred in the coupled atmosphere-ice-ocean system this year which may have\nfavored rapid growth of the coccolithophores. Winter sea ice conditions exhibited average areal and latitudinal extent but\nmelt back appeared to be unusually rapid. In spring and summer, there were reduced numbers of energetic storms and\nanomalously cloud free conditions. One consequence was that greater stratification than usual occurred over the shelf.\nSea surface temperatures were up to 3ï¿¸ C above normal in June. The decrease in storms and clouds resulted from\natmospheric connections to the current El Nino occurring in the equatorial Pacific. The warm waters were not due to a\ndirect oceanic connection to the ongoing El Nino. \n\nAquamarine waters were first observed in early July. By this time, the normal summer Phytoplankton community had\nprobably been replaced by coccolithophores. Characteristic of these blooms is surface waters that have high reflectance,\nlow chlorophyll and particulate organic carbon concentrations. Light penetration and visibility in the aquamarine waters\nwere markedly reduced, with Secchi depths of one-third normal being observed (2 meters in bloom areas versus about 6\nmeters in non-bloom areas). Light extinction coefficients at Nunivak Island, as determined by the PAR sensor on the CTD\n(conductivity, temperature, depth measurements), doubled from June to August (0.07/meter in June and 0.14/meter in\nAugust). By September, the areal extent of the bloom was 700x300 kilometers. The vertical extent of the bloom, based on\nunderwater video observations made in September, varied from a thin layer to a layer up to 50 meters deep. In some\nareas near shore the layer extended to the sea floor. At that time the bloom had been evident for two months which is\nlonger than most recorded blooms. \n\nThe conditions near the inner front off Cape Newenham provide an example of the abnormal conditions. In June,\nnitrogenous nutrients were depleted from the bottom layer of the middle shelf and the inner front was not well developed.\nShort-tailed shearwaters (Puffinus tenuirostris), however, were eating their normal diet of adult euphausiids and had\nnormal body weights. In mid-July, densities of seabirds were lower in the eastern edge of the aquamarine waters of outer\nBristol Bay. In general, however, the condition and behavior of pelagic seabirds was normal during July. Large feeding\nflocks of short-tailed shearwaters were observed on the middle shelf. By the first week of August, coastal die-offs of birds\nwere reported. During the late summer and early fall, a major die-off occurred with thousands of dead birds washing\nashore. In the fall, observations near the Pribilof Islands and off Nunivak Island substantiated the reports. Corpses of\nbirds were conspicuous in areas affected by the bloom. Both dead and living shearwaters had significantly reduced body\nmass compared to birds collected in June, indicating starvation. In addition to the typical diet for shearwaters in Bristol\nBay of euphausiids, fish and squid were also being ingested. Those birds ingesting euphausiids were preying upon the\nsmaller juvenile stages. Additionally, foraging shearwaters appeared to avoid areas with aquamarine water (both around\nthe inner fronts and at the Pribilof Islands), where they may have had difficulty in detecting and capturing prey under the\nexisting low underwater light conditions. Given the observations to date, we believe starvation was the prime cause of the\nshearwater die-off. \n\nOther changes were evident in the ecosystem. The Bristol Bay salmon run was at least 15 million fish below predictions.\nEvidence from a test fishery at Port Moller suggests that the fish were dying on their way to Bristol Bay. Salmon were\nfound to be more common in the diets of the northern fur seal than in previous years. Redistributions of some species of\nwhales in the southeast Bering Sea may have occurred, but there are few large-scale synoptic surveys of cetaceans\navailable for comparison during the past 20 years. During July, five species of large whales (humpback whales -\nMegaptera novaeangliae, fin whale - Balaenoptera physalus, sei whale - Balaenoptera borealis, minke whale -\nBalaenoptera acutorostrata, and right whale - Eubalaena glacialis) and harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) were\nobserved either in or near the coccolithophore bloom on the middle shelf. This suggests that the bloom and adjacent\nwaters provided productive foraging for cetaceans and their prey. Comparison of this year with more normal years in the\nfuture will be needed to confirm the changes in feeding behavior.",
