    "description": "Aerial and ship-based surveys of Steller sea lions (Eumetopias\n                        jubatus) were conducted during June and July 1994 from\n                        Forrester Island in Southeast Alaska to Attu Island in the western\n                        Aleutian Islands. A total of 32,945 adults and juvenile Steller sea\n                        lions were counted at 95 trend rookery and haulout sites. This\n                        represents decreases of 5.5% from 1992 counts (34,844) and\n                        13.7% from 1990 (38,154). Annual rates of change, as estimated\n                        by linear regression, were -2.8% from 1992 to 1994 (P < 0.05)\n                        and -3.7% from 1990 to 1994 (P = 0.008). In 1994, 23,452\n                        adult and juvenile sea lions were counted on trend rookery sites\n                        throughout Alaska. This represents a decrease of 14.9% from\n                        1990 counts (27,563) and a 9.3% decrease from 1992 counts\n                        (25,849). Estimated annual rates of change for 32 trend rookeries\n                        throughout Alaska were -3.9% (P = 0.017) for 1990-94 and\n                        -4.9% (P < 0.005) for 1992-94.\n\n                        The area between the Kenai Peninsula and Kiska Island includes\n                        69 trend rookery and haulout sites. Since 1990, adult Steller sea\n                        lions decreased 17.8% on these trend sites. Between 1992 and\n                        1994, the number of adult Steller sea lions on trend sites\n                        decreased 9.5%. Annual rates of change of adult Steller sea lions\n                        on trend sites have been -4.9% (P < 0.001) for 1990-94, and\n                        -5.0% (P < 0.001) for 1992-94. \n\n                        The 26 trend rookeries contained 14,505 sea lions in 1994. This\n                        represents a decrease of 22.4% from the 1990 count (18,694)\n                        and a 12.6% decrease from the 1992 count. Annual rates of\n                        change were -7.1% (P = 0.028) for 1990-94, and -6.7% (P <\n                        0.001) for 1992-94. Throughout Alaska the greatest decreases at\n                        trend rookery sites were seen in the central Gulf of Alaska\n                        (-28.0%; 4,306 in 1992 to 3,099 in 1994) and the western\n                        Aleutian Islands (-28.3%; 2,531 in 1992 to 1,815 in 1994). The\n                        smallest decreases were in the western Gulf of Alaska (-4.8%;\n                        3,313 in 1992 to 3,155 in 1994) and the eastern Aleutian Islands\n                        (-5.3%; 3,712 in 1992 to 3,515 in 1994). The only increase\n                        occurred in Southeast Alaska, up 9.3% from the 1992 count\n                        (5,945 in 1992 to 6,496 in 1994).\n\n                        A total of 13,850 live pups were counted at 33 rookeries from\n                        Southeast Alaska through the central Aleutian Islands in 1994;\n                        there were no pup counts conducted in the western Aleutian\n                        Islands during 1994. Since 1991-92, pup production has\n                        decreased at rookeries in all of the Alaska subareas: Southeast\n                        Alaska (-11.3%), eastern Gulf of Alaska (-11.4%), central Gulf of\n                        Alaska (-27.4%), western Gulf of Alaska (-8.0%), and eastern\n                        Aleutian Islands (-14.5%). The number of pups counted has\n                        decreased by 24% in the central Aleutian Islands since 1989-90.\n                        At Walrus Island (Bering Sea) a total of 61 pups were counted in\n                        1994, compared to 63 pups counted there in 1992--a decrease of\n                        3.1%.",
