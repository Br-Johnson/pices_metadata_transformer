    "description": "This two-part project will inform the public about NPMR through a radio series about the Bering Sea and a high school/junior high level classroom reference guide to the Bering Sea, both based on NPMR areas of study. The U.S. Congress intends that NPMR studies lead to greater understanding of ecosystem dynamics in the North Pacific Ocean, and the transfer of useful findings to people and groups who have an economic, social, or moral stake in the long-term health of the region. Users of the\ninformation include the scientific community, policy makers, resource managers, marine industries (especially the commercial fishing industry), conservationists, subsistence users, and the general public.  Part one of this project is a 12-installment radio series based on NPMR areas of study. The series will be broadcast on Alaska Public Radio stations and on other broadcast outlets in and outside Alaska. The stories will explain key physical, chemical, and biological phenomena in the ecosystem to provide the public with a good understanding of the basic make-up and dynamics of the North Pacific ecosystem. Possible subjects include the effect of the ice edge on primary production, the effect of sea surface temperature on selected marine animals,\ncirculation and upwelling patterns and their effects on commercially important fish and shellfish, the relationship between climate change and the ecology of marine mammals, and Native perspectives on how specific components of the ecosystem have appeared\nto have changed over the past half century. Each of the 12 radio segments will be 5 minutes long and include high quality digitized sound effects recorded in the field, and first-person interviews with NPMR scientists. Part two of this project will be a classroom guide to the Bering Sea, aimed at junior high/high school level students and teachers. The book will include information covered by the radio series, augmented by additional text, color photos, various figures such as maps and information graphics, and color\nillustrations of North Pacific marine plants and animals and their habitats. The book will include an index of terms and place names, and a glossary of terms.\n\nhttp://www2.sfos.uaf.edu:8080/npmr/projects/data/124/project124.html\n\n\nhttp://www.uaf.edu/seagrant\n\nAn NPMR project",
