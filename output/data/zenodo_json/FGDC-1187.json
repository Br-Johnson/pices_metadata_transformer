    "description": "The distributions of C, Al, Si, P, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn and Pb in suspended and settling particulate matter from Puget Sound were studied to investigate the\nprocesses affecting the uptake of trace metals by particulate phases. Particulate material was collected by water filtration procedures and sequentially-sampling\nsediment traps during approximately bimonthly surveys from December 1980 through December 1981 at a station located in the center of the main basin of Puget\nSound. The samples were selectively extracted for trace metals associated with oxide, organic, and residual phases and analyzed by graphite furnace atomic\nabsorption spectrophotometry and X-ray energy spectrometry. The results show that for Mn, Fe, Zn and Pb, residual and oxide phases were the most important\nphases controlling the vertical flux; whereas residual and organic phases controlled the vertical flux of Cu. The average annual flux data were used along with\ndissolved metal profiles to compute scavenging residence times for several trace metals in Puget Sound. Relatively short scavenging residence times (i.e. <30 days)\nwere calculated for those metals that were significantly enriched in oxide phases, such as Fe, Mn and Pb. In contrast, longer scavenging residence times (>100 days)\nwere calculated for metals enriched in organic phases, such as Cu.",
