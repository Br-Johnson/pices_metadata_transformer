    "description": "Baseline measurements of the spatial and temporal variability of suspended particulate matter (SPM) within a proposed deep-sea mining\narea were conducted during 1975 and 1976. A total of 36 stations were occupied along three 360-nautical-mile N-S transects centered\nat 15°N, 126°W; 11°40N,138°25W; and 8°25N, 150°40W. In general, the water column showed typical open-ocean SPM\nconcentrations: 20-100 µg liter in the euphotic zone, <15 µg liter in the intermediate and deep waters, and a slight increase in the\nbottom waters. Distributions of SPM within the upper 200 m varied both zonally and meridionally, apparently in response to the equatorial\ncurrent systems. The highest SPM concentrations occurred above the inferred divergence between the North Equatorial Current and the\nNorth Equatorial Countercurrent. Temporal changes in the SPM distribution were noted. Seasonal variations were slight, except for\nchanges attributable to migration of the upwelling zone associated with the equatorial current systems. Diurnal variations were measured\nduring 38-hour time series observations at three stations and consisted of 10- to 20-m vertical excursions of the SPM contours that\noccurred with a period of 4 to 20 hours or less. Elemental chemistry analysis by thin-film x-ray fluorescence indicates that most (>85\npercent) of the SPM in the surface, intermediate, and deep waters is of biogenic origin. Increased SPM concentration in the bottom water\nis a result of an increase in the nonbiogenic (aluminosilicate) fraction by resuspension of local bottom sediments. These baseline\nmeasurements provide information concerning the natural variability of SPM in a proposed mining area. Background values of SPM may\nbe used to assess environmental changes caused by deep-sea mining operations. Monitoring of a mining debris plume by optical or\ngravimetric methods is feasible only while its concentration above the ambient SPM significantly exceeds the natural variability. Chemical\nanalysis of collected SPM, however, should allow detection of even relatively low concentrations of the predominantly nonbiogenic mining\ndebris.",
