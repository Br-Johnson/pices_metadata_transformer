    "description": "Data obtained during the Bering Sea Cruise, 11 - 26 June 1997\n\nSolar radiation. We measured solar radiation almost continuously in seven wavebands between 411 and 700 nm,\nincluding the wavebands corresponding to the SeaWiFS sensor. Data have been converted to records of\nphotosynthetically available radiation, useful for biological models. Information on changes in spectral composition of\nsolar irradiance with time of day and cloud cover will be very useful for interpreting data from the drifters: ocean color\nmeasurements can then be corrected for changes in the spectrum of sunlight.\n\nUpwelling radiance. A tethered radiometer buoy was used to measure upwelling radiance (Lu(l), W m-2 nm-1 sr-1) and\ndownwelling solar irradiance (Ed(l), W m-2 nm-1) in 13 wavebands between 323 and 700 nm. We have results for 80\n5-min intervals during which surface chlorophyll was measured and samples were taken for measurement of spectral\nabsorption by particulates and dissolved organic matter (DOM). The data are appropriate for developing algorithms for\nestimating chlorophyll and DOM from ocean color as measured by the drifters, moorings, aircraft, or (if it is ever clear)\nsatellites. Solar-stimulated chlorophyll fluorescence (signal at 683 nm) was measured by the radiometer, and algorithms\nwill be developed. Measurements in UV wavelengths will be useful for future projects.\n\nReflectance spectra (Lu(l)/Ed(l)) from the cruise show clearly\nthe biologically-determined optical variability associated with\nthe eddy. In this plot, data from entire deployments of the\nradiometer buoy are described with medians and quartiles.\n\nAbsorption by Phytoplankton (strong between ca. 400 - 500\nnm) reduces reflectance in the blue. Decreases in blue\nreflectance indicate increases in chlorophyll concentration, as\ndo increases in the fluorescence signal at 683 nm. We see\nblue water to the west of the eddy, high-chlorophyll waters\nnear the edges, and lower-chlorophyll water near the middle.\n\nChlorophyll a. We measured the concentration of chlorophyll a\nfluorometrically in triplicate for more than 275 samples, and\nthe data are available for distribution. Some samples were\nalso frozen for parallel determination in the lab using\nfluorometric methods and HPLC. Generally, we sampled with a\nbucket during radiometer deployments (depth = 0) and also\nfrom 4 depths sampled with the corresponding CTD. We\nsampled oligotrophic and mesotrophic waters with good\ncoverage, and also some bloom waters.\n\nPenetration of spectral irradiance. During most deployments of\nthe tethered radiometer, we used a free-falling multichannel profiling radiometer to measure downwelling irradiance in 12\nwavebands, including those of the SeaWiFS sensors. High-quality data were obtained, which will allow us to calculate\ndiffuse attenuation coefficients for each waveband as functions of depth for each profile. We will report diffuse\nattenuation coefficients at 490 nm and relate these coefficients quantitatively to upwelling radiance ratios.\n\nAncillary measurements. Richard Davis coordinated this field effort and he, Sophie Johannessen and Jean-Paul Parkhill\n(Dalhousie) contributed substantially. Sophie and Jean-Paul also conducted research for their doctoral theses. Sophie\ncollected samples for the determination of absorption coefficients for the dissolved fraction and also for photochemical\ncharacterization in the lab. Jean-Paul used fluorescence techniques to explore physiological characteristics of\nPhytoplankton in different nutrient regimes.",

    "notes": "Purpose: Our objective was to use measurements of near-surface optical properties to determine and compare the mean\nconcentrations and temporal variability of surface chlorophyll within and outside at least one mesoscale eddy in the SE\nBering Sea. This variability was to be related to the relevant physics associated with the eddy. During operations in the\nBering Sea, 11 - 26 June 1997, we collected the necessary measurements of biological and optical properties of surface\nwaters. The hydrographic field was described by Phyllis Stabeno and colleagues and a persistent eddy was well\ncharacterized. Six drifting radiometers were deployed in or near the eddy, and measurements of position, temperature,\nand ocean color have been received throughout the summer. As of September 1997, much of the data from the cruise,\nand available data from the drifters have been tabulated and examined. Indications are that the we have the information\nwe need to achieve our objectives. Additional data from two moorings on the SE Bering Sea Shelf will be analyzed when\nthey become available.\n\nStatus: Complete\n\nMaintenance frequency: Unknown\n\nAccess constraints: None\n\nUse constraints: None\n\nDistribution liability: While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system. NOAA makes no warranty, expressed or implied, nor does the fact of distribution constitute such a warranty.\n\nFGDC metadata date: 19990505\nFGDC metadata contact: Kimberly Bahl\nFGDC metadata standard: Content Standards for Digital Geospatial Metadata (version: FGDC-STD-001-1998)",
