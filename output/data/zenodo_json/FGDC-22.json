    "description": "Week-long samples of airborne particulate matter were obtained at Alert,\n     Northwest Territories, Canada, between 1980 and 1991. The concentrations of\n     24 particulate constituents have some strong, persistent seasonal variations that\n     depend on the transport from their sources. In order to explore the nature of the\n     cyclical variation of the different processes that give rise to the measured\n     concentrations, the observations were arranged into both a two-way matrix and a\n     three-way data array. For the latter, the three modes consist of chemical\n     constituents, weeks within a year, and years. The two-way bilinear model and a\n     three-way trilinear model were used to fit the data and a new data analysis\n     technique, positive matrix factorization (PMF), has been used to obtain the\n     solutions. PMF utilizes the error estimates of the observations to provide an\n     optimal pointwise scaling data array for weighting, which enables it to handle\n     missing data, a common occurrence in environmental measurements. It can also\n     apply nonnegative constraints to the factors. Five factors have been obtained that\n     reproduce the data quite well for both two-way and three-way analyses. Each\n     factor represents a probable source with a compositional profile and distinctive\n     seasonal variations. Specifically, there are (i) an acid photochemical factor typified\n     by Br, H+, and SO24 and characterized by a concentration maximum around\n     April, or shortly after polar sunrise; (ii) a soil factor representing by Si, Al, and Ca\n     and having its main seasonal maximum in September and October; (iii) an\n     anthropogenic factor dominated by SO24 together with metallic species like Pb,\n     Zn, V, As, Sb, Se, In, etc., peaking from December to April; (iv) a sea salt factor\n     consisting mainly of Cl, Na, and K with maximum concentrations during the\n     period from October to April; and (v) a biogenic factor characterized by\n     methanesulfonate and having a primary maximum at May and a secondary\n     maximum in August. The results obtained by both two-way and three-way PMF\n     analyses are generally consistent with one another. However, there are differences\n     because of additional constraints on the solution imposed by the three-way\n     analysis. The results also help to confirm the hypotheses regarding the origins of\n     the Arctic aerosol.",
