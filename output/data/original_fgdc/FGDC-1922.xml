      <abstract>Report includes the texts of the invited state-of-the-art overviews of atmosphere-ocean modeling, lower trophic level models, upper trophic level models, and model integration and management issues.  Also includes a report of MODEL Task Team meetings at the end of the workshop and just prior to the fifth Annual PICES meeting, in which the workshop results are distilled into a plan for action regarding the Climate Change and Carrying Capacity (CCCC) modeling activities.  Summaries of the Japan-GLOBEC symposium and reports of national GLOBEC activities in member nations are included as appendices.
