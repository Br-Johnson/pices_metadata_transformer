      <abstract>The Alaska Fisheries Science Center conducted the second annual
                        National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) longline survey to
                        study the abundance and biological condition of sablefish
                        (Anoplopoma fimbria) and other Groundfish along the upper
                        continental slope of the Gulf of Alaska during the summer of 1988.
                        This survey replicated the 1987 survey, with some modifications to
                        the sampling gear and a change in the bait from Pacific herring
                        (Clupea pallasi) to Atlantic squid (Illex spp.). Sampled stations
                        were the same as those used during the Japan-U.S. cooperative
                        longline survey which has been conducted in the Gulf of Alaska
                        from 1979 to 1988. In addition, 11 stations were sampled in
                        gullies. The most notable change in abundance during the second
                        NMFS survey was the decrease in sablefish and the increase in
                        giant grenadiers (Albatrossia pectoralis) in the western Gulf of
                        Alaska. Sablefish relative abundance was the highest of any
                        species, followed by grenadiers. Sablefish abundance indices were
                        highest in the 401-600 m depth interval and grenadiers were most
                        abundant in 801-1,000 m. Those two species accounted for
                        83.1% of the total relative population number (RPN) and 93.9%
                        of the relative population weight (RPW). Rockfish (Sebastes
                        aleutianus and S. borealis), Pacific cod (Gadus
                        macrocephalus), and arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias)
                        together comprised 10.8% and 5.5% of the total RPN and total
                        RPW.</abstract>
      <purpose>To report on the assessment of Gulf of Alaska sablefish and other Groundfish species based on the 1988 National Marine Fisheries Service longline survey.</purpose>
