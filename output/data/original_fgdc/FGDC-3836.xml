        <p>Genetic stock identification (GSI) with allozyme variation was used for determining the stock origin of chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) caught by trawl operations of R/V Kaiyo maru in the central Bering Sea from late August to mid September 2002. Chum salmon were widely distributed in the Bering Sea north of 52Â°N, and they were relatively abundant in the eastern waters off the continental shelf. The mixture chum samples were 97% immature fish, and the age composition was 29% ocean age .1, 54% ocean age .2, and 13% ocean age .3 fish. The estimated stock composition for all maturing chum salmon was 70% Japanese, 10% Russian, and 20% North American stocks, and 54% Japanese, 33% Russian, and 13% North American stocks for immature fish. The stock estimates of immature chum salmon were similar among three age groups (0.1, 0.2 and 0.3). Asian stocks were widely distributed in the survey areas, being relatively abundant in eastern water. North American stocks were mainly distributed in eastern water. Regional stock composition estimates of immature chum salmon biomass in the whole survey areas were 47% Japanese, 34% Russian, and 19% North American stocks.</p>
