      <abstract>During the late summer of 1997, for the first time ever recorded, most of the continental shelf of the eastern Bering Sea
was covered by aquamarine waters (Figure 1) which resulted from a massive bloom of coccolithophores (Figure 2).
Reflectance of light off the calcium carbonate plates of the flagellated coccolithophores gave the water its anomalous
color, which was first observed in July. The bloom was also clearly visible from space, as shown by some of the first
images from the multispectral SeaWiFS scanner in September. Light penetration into the water column, essential for
primary production by diatoms and other Phytoplankton, was markedly reduced. This shift in the dominant primary
producers potentially altered the trophic dynamics throughout the food web of one of world's most productive
ecosystems. Prior to and during the bloom, anomalous atmospheric and oceanic conditions were evident. In July, large
whales were relatively abundant in the region of the middle shelf where the bloom occurred. Concomitant with the bloom
of coccolithophores were die offs of seabirds and a decrease in the number of salmon returning to Bristol Bay. Reports of
die-offs of seabirds began in early August. Field operations conducted as part of the National Science Foundation's Inner
Front project and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Coastal Ocean Program and Fisheries
Oceanography Coordinated Investigations provide a wealth of data to explore this year's anomalous conditions. 

The eastern Bering Sea shelf (Figure 3) consists of domains characterized by water properties, water column structure
and plankton dynamics. Coastal water (depth less than 50 m) is typically mixed by a combination of tidal and wind stirring.
Water over the middle shelf (depth 50-100 m) usually has two well mixed layers: the upper a result of the annual melt of
sea ice and/or solar heating while the lower remains cold and rich in nutrients essential for Phytoplankton growth.
Separating the domains is a structure or inner front which extends for over 1000 km around the shelf. The dynamics of
the inner front likely provide nitrogenous nutrients for the prolonged primary and secondary production which typically
occurs there. Typical springtime Phytoplankton blooms in the Bering Sea are comprised of diatoms and are associated
with increased water column stratification as a result of sea-ice meltback or solar radiation. Summertime Phytoplankton
blooms of the magnitude observed this year are rare, in part because the nutrients for plant growth are generally thought
to be limiting. Zooplankton biomass may be enhanced two different ways: increased secondary production via increased
food availability for herbivorous grazers, and physical concentration of grazers due to convergence of water at the front.
As a result of the favorable conditions generated by this increase in prey biomass, massive flocks of seabirds return each
year to feed at the front and breed in Alaskan waters. 

A sequence of unusual phenomena occurred in the coupled atmosphere-ice-ocean system this year which may have
favored rapid growth of the coccolithophores. Winter sea ice conditions exhibited average areal and latitudinal extent but
melt back appeared to be unusually rapid. In spring and summer, there were reduced numbers of energetic storms and
anomalously cloud free conditions. One consequence was that greater stratification than usual occurred over the shelf.
Sea surface temperatures were up to 3ï¿¸ C above normal in June. The decrease in storms and clouds resulted from
atmospheric connections to the current El Nino occurring in the equatorial Pacific. The warm waters were not due to a
direct oceanic connection to the ongoing El Nino. 

Aquamarine waters were first observed in early July. By this time, the normal summer Phytoplankton community had
probably been replaced by coccolithophores. Characteristic of these blooms is surface waters that have high reflectance,
low chlorophyll and particulate organic carbon concentrations. Light penetration and visibility in the aquamarine waters
were markedly reduced, with Secchi depths of one-third normal being observed (2 meters in bloom areas versus about 6
meters in non-bloom areas). Light extinction coefficients at Nunivak Island, as determined by the PAR sensor on the CTD
(conductivity, temperature, depth measurements), doubled from June to August (0.07/meter in June and 0.14/meter in
August). By September, the areal extent of the bloom was 700x300 kilometers. The vertical extent of the bloom, based on
underwater video observations made in September, varied from a thin layer to a layer up to 50 meters deep. In some
areas near shore the layer extended to the sea floor. At that time the bloom had been evident for two months which is
longer than most recorded blooms. 

The conditions near the inner front off Cape Newenham provide an example of the abnormal conditions. In June,
nitrogenous nutrients were depleted from the bottom layer of the middle shelf and the inner front was not well developed.
Short-tailed shearwaters (Puffinus tenuirostris), however, were eating their normal diet of adult euphausiids and had
normal body weights. In mid-July, densities of seabirds were lower in the eastern edge of the aquamarine waters of outer
Bristol Bay. In general, however, the condition and behavior of pelagic seabirds was normal during July. Large feeding
flocks of short-tailed shearwaters were observed on the middle shelf. By the first week of August, coastal die-offs of birds
were reported. During the late summer and early fall, a major die-off occurred with thousands of dead birds washing
ashore. In the fall, observations near the Pribilof Islands and off Nunivak Island substantiated the reports. Corpses of
birds were conspicuous in areas affected by the bloom. Both dead and living shearwaters had significantly reduced body
mass compared to birds collected in June, indicating starvation. In addition to the typical diet for shearwaters in Bristol
Bay of euphausiids, fish and squid were also being ingested. Those birds ingesting euphausiids were preying upon the
smaller juvenile stages. Additionally, foraging shearwaters appeared to avoid areas with aquamarine water (both around
the inner fronts and at the Pribilof Islands), where they may have had difficulty in detecting and capturing prey under the
existing low underwater light conditions. Given the observations to date, we believe starvation was the prime cause of the
shearwater die-off. 

Other changes were evident in the ecosystem. The Bristol Bay salmon run was at least 15 million fish below predictions.
Evidence from a test fishery at Port Moller suggests that the fish were dying on their way to Bristol Bay. Salmon were
found to be more common in the diets of the northern fur seal than in previous years. Redistributions of some species of
whales in the southeast Bering Sea may have occurred, but there are few large-scale synoptic surveys of cetaceans
available for comparison during the past 20 years. During July, five species of large whales (humpback whales -
Megaptera novaeangliae, fin whale - Balaenoptera physalus, sei whale - Balaenoptera borealis, minke whale -
Balaenoptera acutorostrata, and right whale - Eubalaena glacialis) and harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) were
observed either in or near the coccolithophore bloom on the middle shelf. This suggests that the bloom and adjacent
waters provided productive foraging for cetaceans and their prey. Comparison of this year with more normal years in the
future will be needed to confirm the changes in feeding behavior.</abstract>
