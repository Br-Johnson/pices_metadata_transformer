      <abstract>Each spring, bowhead whales return to the Arctic Ocean after a year feeding in the Bering Sea that separates Alaska and Russia. Awaiting them in Alaska are both hunters
and scientists. As Doug Schneider reports in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio, bowhead numbers are at their highest level in nearly a decade.</abstract>
      <purpose>The annual hunt for bowhead whales is finally over in the Inupiat Eskimo village of Barrow, on Alaska's north coast. Native hunters harvested 20 bowheads that were each
processed and divided among village residents. North Slope Borough whale biologist Craig George says this year's hunt was a good one, despite the broken ice that choked open leads and fog that made for poor visibility.</purpose>
