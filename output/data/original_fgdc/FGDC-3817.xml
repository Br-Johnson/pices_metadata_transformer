        <p>As part of the Bering-Aleutian Salmon International Survey (BASIS) effort to survey the Bering Sea, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Ocean Carrying Capacity (OCC) program conducted a fall survey on the eastern Bering Sea shelf to provide key ecological data for the eastern Bering Sea salmon stocks during their juvenile life-history stage.</p>
        <p>
          The survey was conducted aboard the contracted fishing vessel (F/V)
          <em>Sea Storm</em>
          .  Oceanographic data were collected at each trawl station immediately prior to each trawl haul. Profiles of salinity and temperature from surface to near bottom depths were collected using a Sea-Bird SBE 19 Seacat profiler. Plankton samples were collected using 60-cm diameter bongo samplers fitted with 505- and 333-Î¼m mesh nets. The bongo nets were towed obliquely from near surface to approximately 10 m from the bottom; the estimated depth of each bongo tow was calculated by wire angle and length of wire. The volume of water filtered by each net was estimated by flow meters, and the plankton samples were preserved in 10% formalin.
