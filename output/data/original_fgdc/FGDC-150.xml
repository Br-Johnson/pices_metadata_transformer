        <p>Publication Title: Monthly Mean Charts Sea Surface Temperature North Pacific Ocean 1949-1962.</p>
        <p>Contains summarized monthly mean sea surface temperature charts.  Marine weather observations including sea-water temperature for the period of record, January 1949 through December 1962, are conatined in Punched Card Deck 116 of the NWRC.  This atlas deals only with sea surface temperature data from the Pacific Ocean north of latitude 20Â°S.  The 14-year series of data are concentrated to a considerable degree along frequently traveled trade routes.  Observations are particularly sparse in the tropical areas.  The quantity of data varies also with time.  The fields of surface (or near surface) sea temperature, arranged chronologically by month and year, are represented by isotherms drawn for each whole degree Centigrade.  The analyses were not carried into the Bering Sea, Okhotsk Sea, Japan Sea, Yellow Sea, or South China Sea.</p>
