        <p>Four days of currents was obtained about 190 km NNE of Bering Strait during March 1968.  The mean current was the same for the location as in summer, suggesting that the generally north flow from the Bering Sea to the Arctic Ocean occurs also in winter.</p>
        <p>Variations in speed and direction of the flow were identified and analyzed.  The major periodic variation was due to the diurnal tidal wave, and thus the tidal waves rather than inertial currents must be the primary cause of periodic variations.  The course of the tidal wave and some features of its behavior are inferred.  Other variations of importance include a variation with a period somewhat greater than 2 days, probably caused by atmosphere phenomena, and fluctations due to relatively large-scale turbulence (periods between 5 and 60 min).</p>
