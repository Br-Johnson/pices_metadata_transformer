      <abstract>Animals, fish and birds have devised lots of ways to avoid being eaten by hungry predators. As Doug Schneider reports in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio, even  the red king crabs living on the sea floor off Alaska have a  trick or two for confusing predators.</abstract>
      <purpose>Several times each week, crab researchers Pete Cummiskey and Eric Munk make the short drive from the fishing town of Kodiak, Alaska, out past the U.S. Coast Guard base to Womens Bay, a picturesque inlet that at this time of year is surrounded by snowcapped hills and mountains. 

They launch their small inflatable skiff and motor a short ways off shore. Cutting the engine, they lower a device called a sonar signal receiver into the water. The receiver picks up the sound from tiny transmitters glued to the shells of four juvenile red king crab. After a few minutes, Munk and Cummiskey figure they're close to the tagged crabs. They put scuba tanks over their dry suits and slip over the side into the ocean.

Forty feet beneath the surface, Munk and Cummiskey have found more than the four crab they fitted with transmitters. They've homed in on a giant, tangled ball of crab literally thousands of them on the sea floor. Cummiskey has seen this behavior before. It's called a crab pod.</purpose>
