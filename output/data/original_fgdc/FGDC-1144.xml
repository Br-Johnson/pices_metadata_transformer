      <abstract>The East Blanco Depression (EBD), a pull-apart basin within the western Blanco Transform Fault Zone (BTFZ), was the site of an intense earthquake T-wave
swarm that began at 1317Z on January 9, 1994. Although tectonically generated earthquakes occur frequently along the BTFZ, this swarm was unusual in that it
was preceded and accompanied by periodic, low-frequency, long-duration acoustic signals, that originated from near the swarm epicenters. These tremor-like
signals were very similar in character to acoustic energy produced by a shallow-submarine eruption near Socorro Island, a seamount several hundred km west of
Baja, California. The ~69 earthquakes and ~400 tremor-like events at the EBD occurred sporadically, with two periods of peak activity occurring between January
5-16 and 27-31. The swarm-like character of the earthquakes and the similarity of the tremor activity to the Socorro eruption indicated that the EBD was
undergoing an intrusion or eruption episode. On January 27, six CTD/rosette casts were conducted at the site. Water samples from two of the stations yielded
anomalous He concentrations, with maxima at ~2800 m depth over the main basin. In June 1994 two camera tows within the basin yielded evidence of pillow-lava
volcanism and hydrothermal deposits, but no conclusive evidence of a recent seafloor eruption. In September 1994, deployments of the U.S. Navy's Advanced
Tethered Vehicle resulted in the discovery of an active hydrothermal mound on the flanks of a pillow-lava volcano. The hydrothermal mound consists of Fe-rich
hydrothermal precipitate and bacterial mats. Temperatures to 60Â°C were measured 30 cm below the surface. This is the first discovery of active hydrothermal vents
along an oceanic fracture zone. Although no conclusive evidence of volcanic activity associated with the T-wave event swarm was found during these response
efforts, the EBD has been the site of recent seafloor eruptions.</abstract>
