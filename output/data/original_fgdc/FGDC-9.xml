      <abstract>Alaska's Bristol Bay fishery for red king crab Paralithodes camtschaticus is an
     example of a high-value, high-effort fishery characterized by short seasons and
     difficult in-season management. Pot limits are viewed as one potential way of
     reducing management problems. Two pot limit schemes were considered here:
     fixed pot limits, where each vessel is limited to the same number of pots, and
     proportional reduction requirements, where each vessel must reduce its
     number of pots (determined by past registration) by the same percentage.
     Production functions relating vessel performance to pot numbers were
     estimated. These models were subsequently employed in model simulations to
     evaluate potential effects various pot limit regulations may have on fleet
     performance. Results of this study suggest that the 1992 decision of the
     Alaska Board of Fisheries to implement a fixed limit of 250 pots per vessel in
     the Bristol Bay red king crab fishery (a decision that since has been revoked)
     may have conflicted with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and
     Management Act and the North Pacific Fishery Management Council's plan
     for the Bering Sea-Aleutian Islands king crab fisheries. Additionally, the
     enacted pot limit may not have achieved desired management objectives.</abstract>
