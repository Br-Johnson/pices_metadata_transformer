      <abstract>Time sequences of surface based measurements of passive microwave
        emission from growing saline ice reported by Wensnahan et al. (1993) are
        used to explore the possibility of developing a satellite based sea ice
        concentration algorithm which solves for the presence of thinner ice. It is
        shown that two classes of thinner ice can be distinguished from mixtures of
        open water (OW), first-year (FY) ice, and multiyear (MY) ice. The two
        classes do not necessarily correspond to specific World Meteorological
        Organization ice types; rather, newly formed ice represents a brief transition
        spectrum between OW and thin ice. Newly formed ice appears to be optically
        thick at 37 and 90 GHz and has a relatively dry surface. The thin ice spectrum
        occurs when the ice is greater than 4 cm thick and appears to result from the
        accumulation of brine at the surface of the ice. Thin ice has a relatively stable
        spectrum characterized by high brightness temperatures, a near-zero spectral
        gradient at vertical polarization, and a large difference between vertical and
        horizontal polarizations. Supervised principal component analysis (PCA) was
        done of laboratory data using 10 channels of passive data: vertical and
        horizontal polarization at 6.7, 10, 19, 37, and 90 GHz. Analyses were also
        done on subsets of the laboratory data at 6.7 to 37 GHz as well as 19 to 90
        GHz, representing the scanning multichannel microwave radiometer (SMMR)
        and special sensor microwave imager (SSM/I) satellite frequencies,
        respectively. Using all of the channels or the SMMR subset makes it possible
        to solve for mixtures of OW and FY, MY, newly formed and thin ice but with
        large errors. However, any four of these scene types can be distinguished with
        reasonable accuracy. The SSM/I frequencies allow determination of at most
        four of these scene types but with moderate errors. PCA was used in a case
        study of SSM/I data from the Bering Sea for April 2, 1988. Winds from the
        north formed thin ice areas which the NASA Team algorithm interprets as
        large amounts of OW and MY ice. With PCA, these same areas are
        interpreted as 20-30% OW near the lee shores but otherwise as consisting
        almost entirely of thin ice. We conclude that thin ice can be detected using
        satellite data. However, questions remain as to how the thin ice spectrum
        varies with environmental conditions, how it evolves to that of FY, and how
        this evolution affects the predicted concentrations of thin ice.</abstract>
