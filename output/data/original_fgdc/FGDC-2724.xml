        <p>Results of meteorological studies conducted near the edge of the seasonal pack ice in the eastern Bering Sea on the NOAA ship SURVEYOR from 26 February to 10 March 1981 are summarized.  Surface air pressure and air temperature analyses are presented including all late reports for 00 and 12 GMT from 23 February to 21 March.  Upper-air observations from the SURVEYOR, and ST. Paul and Nome, Alaska, are also presented.  Cross sections of the potential temperature in the boundary layer which were made as the ship steamed away from the ice during off-ice winds show the warming and deepening of the atmospheric mixed layer.  The regional weather conditions encountered during this period are discussed and compared to Climatology including this period are discussed and compared to Climatology including the relationship between the atmospheric boundary layer structure and the synoptic weather.</p>
