      <abstract>With animals like sea lions and sea otters in trouble, and salmon returns declining, marine scientists met recently in Anchorage to assess the health of Alaska's oceans. Alaska's seas are still cleaner than most, but just like other places, the oceans that nearly surround the state have their share of problems. As Doug Schneider reports in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio, one scientist says research on the ocean's smallest fish is needed to understand the big changes happening in the marine environment.</abstract>
      <purpose>It often seems that there's no shortage of research being done in Alaska waters. We often hear about studies on whales, seals and other marine mammals. And studies of commercially important fish like halibut and salmon are also common.

But despite a wealth of data, researchers who gathered at a recent Anchorage conference on Alaska's oceans and watersheds said they don't know the intricate details of just how the ocean food chain works and what factors influence it. Doug DeMaster is director of the Alaska Fisheries Science Center. He says more needs to be learned about this and large-scale ecosystem changes triggered by events like climate warming and El Niï¿±o, for example.</purpose>
