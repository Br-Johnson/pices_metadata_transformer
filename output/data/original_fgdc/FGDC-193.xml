      <abstract>PICES, the North Pacific Marine Science Organization was founded in 1992 as an intergovernmental organization to deal with scientific problems in the North Pacific Ocean.  The main purpose of PICES is to promote and coordinate marine scientific research in order to advance scientific knowledge of the Pacific focusing mainly on the area northward from 30 N.  Topics of research include the Bering Sea,  circulation and monitoring of the Subarctic Pacific, coastal pelagic fish, practical assessment methodology, climate change and carrying capacity (PICES-GLOBEC CCCC program) etc.  Scientists under the PICES programs have been focusing on the studies of responses and interactions of ecosystems to changing physical forcing due to climate changes and human actives.  The Republic of Korea, a new member country since 1995, should pay more attention to the PICES actives not only to contribute to the organization but also to benefit its own marine scientific advancement.</abstract>
