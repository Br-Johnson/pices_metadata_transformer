      <abstract>Infaunal and epifaunal mollusks of the northeastern Chukchi Sea were
     sampled and 139 molluscan taxa were identified. The pattern of spatial
     distribution of molluscan species was determined by cluster analysis, which
     resulted in six infaunal and five epifaunal station groups. Species characterizing
     various faunal groups are defined. Stepwise multiple Discriminant analysis was
     applied to correlate Benthic biological associations with environmental
     variables. Delineation of infaunal groups was mainly due to percentage of sand
     and bottom salinity, while epifaunal groups were separated by percent gravel
     and bottom temperature. An increase in abundance and biomass of infaunal
     mollusks occurred adjacent to and north and northwest of an identified bottom
     front between the Bering Shelf and Resident Chukchi Water and Alaska
     Coastal Water. Epifaunal molluscan abundance and biomass were highest
     near the coast. Mollusks, especially smaller species and the juvenile stages of
     larger species, represent a food resource for bottom-feeding predators in the
     study area.</abstract>
