      <abstract>While scientists insist they donﾒt have enough information to blame anyone for the decline of Alaskaﾒs Steller sea lions, fishermen who catch the fish sea lions eat have taken the brunt of the blame. Now, as Doug Schneider reports in this weekﾒs Arctic Science Journeys Radio, fishermen themselves are paying for research aimed at understanding their role in Bering Sea declines.</abstract>
      <purpose>This summer, scientists will head out to Alaska's Bering Sea in hopes of learning why Steller sea lion populations and other marine species have plummeted.  You might think money for such research would come from any of several state and federal agencies that manage these resources. But in fact, the research is being funded by commercial fishermen themselves.
