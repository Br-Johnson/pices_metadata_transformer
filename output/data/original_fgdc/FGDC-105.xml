      <abstract>The Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) of the United States
                        and the Pacific Research Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography
                        (TINRO) of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (U.S.S.R.)
                        conducted a cooperative bottom trawl survey of the Bering Sea
                        aboard the Russian research vessel Novokotovsk during
                        May-July 1990. The primary purpose of this survey was to assess
                        the distribution, abundance, and biological condition of Groundfish
                        resources in both the eastern and western Bering Sea continental
                        shelf. A separate and completely independent trawl survey of the
                        central and southeastern Bering Sea continental shelf was also
                        conducted by the AFSC during this period aboard two U.S.
                        research vessels.

                        Results summarizing geographic distribution, abundance estimates,
                        and size composition are presented for the principal species of fish
                        encountered. The distribution and relative abundance of the
                        commercially important crab species are also shown. Results of
                        the cooperative survey are compared to the results of the separate
                        1990 U.S. survey from the areas commonly fished in the eastern
                        Bering Sea. The appendices include station and catch information,
                        detailed abundance, size, and age data.</abstract>
      <purpose>To report on the results of the U.S.-U.S.S.R. cooperative bottom trawl survey of the eastern and northwestern Bering Sea shelf.</purpose>
