      <abstract>Scientists recently set out to see just how much mercury several species of Alaska fish, including salmon and pike, had in their livers and flesh. While salmon were given a clean bill of health, researchers say high levels of mercury found in a few pike underscores the need for a more comprehensive study. Doug Schneider has more in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio.</abstract>
      <purpose>The mercury was found in the livers and muscle of 21 pike taken from tributaries of the lower Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers in western Alaska. Sathy Naidu is a marine scientist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and leader of the study. He says some of the pike tested had levels of mercury higher than what the U.S. Food and Drug
 Administration considers safe for human consumption.</purpose>
