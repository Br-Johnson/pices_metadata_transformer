      <abstract>Bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) pass near or through offshore oil and
     gas lease areas in the northeastern Chukchi Sea during their westward
     migration each autumn. Results of aerial surveys conducted from
     mid-September through October 1982-1990 indicate that whale distribution
     overlapped lease area boundaries north and east of Point Barrow, Alaska.
     Bowhead relative abundance was high throughout the fall in nearshore
     sub-blocks east, north, and southwest of Point Barrow, with somewhat lower
     indices in offshore sub-blocks northwest of Point Barrow.</abstract>
