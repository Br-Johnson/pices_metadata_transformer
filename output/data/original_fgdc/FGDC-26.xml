      <abstract>The winds within Shelikof Strait, Alaska, have been examined using hourly
     observations from a pair of meteorological buoys moored at the ends of the strait
     for a 6-month period in 1994. The focus is on periods of gap winds, when the
     prominent terrain bordering Shelikof Strait constrains the low-level winds to
     accelerate down the local pressure gradient in a direction approximately parallel
     to the axis of the strait. Statistics have been amassed on the performance of a
     simple, Bernoulli-type gap wind model during periods of downstrait
     (northeasterly) gap flow. A series of model experiments have been conducted to
     elucidate the processes important to gap flow in Shelikof Strait. The model best
     predicts the observed along strait component of the wind at the exit of the strait
     (explaining 74% of the variance) when it includes not just surface friction, but also
     parameterizations of the Coriolis effect due to the cross-strait wind and of
     entrainment. The latter process is studied further using upper-air soundings
     collected at Kodiak, Alaska, immediately upstream of the strait. These
     observations suggest that the entrainment is driven largely by the vertical wind
     shear at the top of the gap flow. Gap winds are favored more during downstrait
     flow than during up strait (southwesterly) flow. The lower terrain on the Kodiak
     Island side of the strait may often represent an insufficient sidewall for upstrait gap
     flow, as suggested by the detailed observations from a NOAA P-3 research
     aircraft flight in May 1996 during upstrait flow. Examination of ECMWF
     operational analyses for the period of buoy observations shows that the alongstrait
     pressure gradient was represented adequately but the surface winds were handled
     poorly. The gap wind model presented here could aid operational forecasting of
     winds in Shelikof Strait, using coarse-resolution analyses or numerical model
     output for its input, and could be adapted for other regions with similar
     topography.</abstract>
