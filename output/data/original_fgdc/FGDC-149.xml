This book is a part of the foreign meteorological data collection held
by the NOAA Central Library in Washington, DC.  Information in this
collection dates back to the 18th century for daily, monthly, seasonal,
and annual tabular summaries, and the 19th century for weather maps.
These data are the result of foreign exchange agreements, but the
collection has not been updated since 1983.
 
In these summaries, definitions are:

1.   Hourly/daily/monthly/seasonal/annual data -- values determined for each consecutive period, e.g. monthly temperature data:  January
     1900, February 1900, etc.

2.  Long-term data -- values determined over a period of years, e.g. long-term monthly temperature data using January 1901,  January 1902,
     etc.
 
This book contains graphs of seawater / freshwater content in the ice vs. temperature, changes in the volumes of the freshwater 
ice between 0 deg and -1 deg, volumes of one cubical centimeter of fresh and salt water at different temperatures, hourly 
temperature-salinity-depth sections,  water color, and  ice along the route of "Veda" expedition form Nordkap to Bering Straits
in 1878.

Graphs contain the following data:  

-volumes of  one cubic centimeter of fresh and salt water Vs state of the ice
-changes in the volume of the fresh water ice between 0 degrees and -1 degree
-volumes of one cubical centimeter of fresh and salt water at different temperatures

Maps contain the following data:

-hourly salinity-temperature-depth for August-September
-daily sea surface temperature and salinity
-daily sea water color, depth, and ice</abstract>
