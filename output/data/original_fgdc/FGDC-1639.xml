        <p>The Resource Assessment and Conservation Engineering (RACE) Division of the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) recently completed a gear research cruise on the west coast upper continental slope. This report summarizes the preliminary results of the cruise.</p>
        <p>A gear research cruise was conducted aboard the NOAA ship Miller Freeman between October 16, 1994, and November 13, 1994, off the coast of Oregon (lat. 44°40' N to lat. 45°35' N) in waters 183 m-1,280 m deep.</p>
        <p>Fish density data from a towed video sled survey to compare with catch rates from an area-swept trawl survey.  Data on species composition and size composition of the catch.  The vessel was named R/V Miller Freeman (USA).</p>

      <purpose>
        <p>The impetus for conducting this research in lieu of the standard survey was the concern voiced by the fishing industry that the slope survey fishing operations are faulty which have led to the restrictive commercial catch quotas on Dover sole (Microstomus pacificus), thornyheads (Sebastolobus spp.) and sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) recently imposed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council in response to 1994 stock assessments. Some
fishermen contend that our trawl survey data are not accurate because there are indications, such as excessive mud in trawl catches and inconsistent gear performance, that the trawl is not fishing properly. In response to their concern, we conducted this experimental cruise to research performance of the survey trawl. Ultimately, we want to insure (or determine) that the poly Nor'eastern bottom trawl performs consistently as a
standardized sampling tool and that it provides a reasonably accurate estimate of fish density.</p>
        <p>To assess how well the slope trawl survey estimates fish density a comparative survey was designed using a video bottom sled. A video sled offers an independent estimate of fish density. Video images will also aid in understanding trawl performance on the upper continental slope by providing details of the habitat's physical and biological characteristics.</p>
