      <abstract>Scientists learn a lot about animals, birds and fish by peering into their stomachs to see what they eat. A new study on how walrus digest their food has scientists rethinking this
marine mammal's impact on the ocean food chain. Doug Schneider has more in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio.</abstract>
      <purpose>Biologists have long known that walrus comb the bottom of the sea, rooting out clams, snails, worms and other creatures from the seabed. But when they've had occasion to
examine the inside of a walrus stomach such as after they've been harvested by Native hunters what they usually find are just the leftover, hard-to-digest pieces of clams. That's led scientists to presume that walrus ate far more clams than anything else.</purpose>
