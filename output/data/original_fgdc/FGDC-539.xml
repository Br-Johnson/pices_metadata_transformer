      <abstract>This project will expand the scope of the Alaska Native Harbor Seal Commission's (ANHSC) present biological sampling efforts to include subsistence hunters in communities west of Prince William Sound. The Commission is a tribal consortium
concerned with self-management of the harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) as a subsistence resource. The ANHSC already conducts a biological sampling program in nine communities and participates in the harvest data assessment program with the
Alaska Department of Fish and Game Subsistence Division. We plan to expand this effort to nine more communities in western Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. Local technicians are selected and trained by the Commission's staff to perform basic necropsies on seals taken by subsistence hunters. Samples from these seals are sent to the University of Alaska Museum (UAM) for distribution to ongoing investigations and for archiving in the permanent collections.  Tissue samples will be archived in the Alaska Frozen Tissue Collection (AFTC) which has become the primary regional archive for frozen zoological samples and a major contributor to environmental studies of the North Pacific and Arctic oceans. It is now the world's third largest frozen tissue collection for wild mammals (Hafner et al. 1997). The increasingly powerful tools of molecular biology and biochemistry and the need to monitor perturbation of the environment are accelerating both collection growth and usage. In addition to supporting expanded
monitoring and sampling by the ANHSC, this project supports additional student help at UAM to process the increased number of samples. This project will increase the scope of sampling from a protected and potentially threatened high-trophic-level subsistence resource, and increase the scope of Native involvement in the study and management of marine resources.
