      <abstract>Data from merchant ships travelling between British Columbia and Japan, from 1980-1990 (Canada Ace), 1995 to 2000, continuing (Skaugran), and 1999-2000, continuing (Alligator Hope). Data collected include surface total carbon dioxide, alkalinity, nutrients, chlorophyll a, carbon-13 in seawater, and atmospheric carbon-13. Underway measurements include position, time, temperature and salinity. Skaugran samples and data were collected 3-4 times daily by scientific staff and once daily by ship`s engineers until 1999, then were reduced to daily engineer`s samples. Alligator Hope samples were collected 3 times daily.</abstract>
      <purpose>Constructing models of North Pacific carbon cycling; air-sea exchange, monitoring long term changes in the North Pacific Ocean, tracking water masses in the ocean, El Nino monitoring</purpose>
      <supplinf>Risk Justification: Custodian will be leaving soon and has a large quantity of data not secured in a regional data centre.
Risk of Loss: High
Impact Justification: Time series of 5 to 10 years
Impact of Loss: Medium
Recommended Action: Obtain access to data, bring data to archives</supplinf>

    <logic>Interlaboratory comparisons of nutrient and carbon-13 and oxygen-18 measurements; comparison to known standards. Salinometer calibrated with standard seawater. Fluorometer calibrated with commercially prepared standard. Data are plotted to detect outlyers.</logic>
    <complete>Dataset Complications: Some CTD data from the Alligator Hope are questionable. Chlorophyll data may be questionable. Canada Ace data are of unknown quality, and therefore will not be released. No data collected 1991-1994. For some programs, fewer parameters were measured.
Electronic Data Complications: Magnetic tapes are older than their guaranteed physical lifespan.</complete>
