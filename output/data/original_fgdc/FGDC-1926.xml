      <abstract>The REX Workshop on "Small Pelagic Species and Climate Change" reviewed the status of national efforts on small pelagic fish and climate research.  The "Lower Trophic Level Model" Workshop sponsored by the MODEL Task Team, dealt with model comparison issues related to the lower trophic level and to gather information for nutrient databases.  The MONITOR Task Team reported results of their first workshop, held to outline the present monitoring activities of PCES nations and to identify future monitoring needs and intercalibration experiments that might be conducted.

      <purpose>To summarizes the results of three workshops organized by the PICES-GLOBEC Climate Change and Carrying Capacity Program that were held just prior to the PICES Seventh Annual Meeting in Fairbanks, Alaska, in October 1998.  These workshops represent the efforts of the REX, MODEL, and MONITOR Task Teams to integrate the results of national GLOBEC and GLOBEC-like programs to arrive at a better understanding of the ways in which climate change affects North Pacific ecosystems.</purpose>
