      <abstract>
        <p>During August 2000, scientists from the Auke Bay Laboratory, Ocean Carrying Capacity (OCC) program conducted a survey of juvenile salmon distribution, migration, and growth along the coastal waters of the eastern Bering Sea. Annual surveys of the eastern Bering Sea by the OCC program were started during 1999 in response to substanially low returns of adult salmon to this region during 1997 and 1998.</p>
        <p>
          The OCC survey of the eastern Bering Sea was conducted during August 20  September 2, 2000. The survey area ranged from 166 °W to 162 °W longitude. Transects sampled during the survey were along longitudinal lines crossing coastal, middle, and outer domains of the eastern Bering Sea shelf. Sampling stations along each transect began and ended at nearshore locations within the coastal domain. The survey was conducted aboard the contracted fishing vessel (F/V)

        <p>Fish samples were collected using a midwater rope trawl, which is 198 m long, has hexagonal mesh in wings and body, and has a 1.2-cm mesh liner in the codend. The rope trawl was towed at 4 to 5 kts, at or near surface, and had a typical spread of 44 m horizontally and 11 m vertically. All tows lasted 30 minutes and covered 2.8 to 4.6 km. All sampling was done during daylight hours.</p>
        <p>Salmon and other fishes were sorted by species and counted. Standard biological measurements including fork length, body weight, and sex as well as scale samples from the preferred area (to document age and growth) were taken from subsamples of all salmon species.</p>
        <p>Oceanographic data were collected at each trawl station immediately prior to each trawl haul. Profiles of salinity and temperature from surface to near bottom depths were collected using a Sea-Bird SBE 19 Seacat profiler1. Plankton samples were collected using 60-cm diameter bongo samplers fitted with 505- and 333 µm mesh nets, respectively. The bongo nets were towed obliquely from near surface to approximately 10 m from the bottom; estimated depth of each bongo tow was calculated by wire angle and length of wire. Volume of water filtered by each net was estimated by flow meters. Plankton samples were preserved in 5% formalin.</p>

      <purpose>To establish and verify the linkage between adult sockeye salmon survival and annual variations in biological characteristics of juvenile sockeye salmon.  Also, to determine the seaward migration pathways of Kuskokwim River juvenile chum salmon as they enter the coastal waters of the Bering Sea.</purpose>
