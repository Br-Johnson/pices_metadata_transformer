      <abstract>As part of an ecological study on the Bering Sea walleye Pollock ( Theragra chalcogramma ( Pallas )), bacterioplankton cell abundance and biomass were measured in the surface water (&lt;5m depth) of the Bering Sea during summer (July) of 1994 and 1995. Bacterioplankton biomass were compared to the surface chlorophyll a and water-column properties, such as temperature, salinity and density.  Bacterioplankton biomass in the surface water ranged from 4 to 67mu-g C L(-1) (average 24 mu C L (-1)) 1994 and from 5 to 42 mu-g C L (-1) (average 20 mug C L (-1)) in 1995.  These values of the biomass were comparable to those in typical oceanic waters and slightly higher than those reported from Antarctic seas.  However, we did not find the close relationships of bacterioplankton biomass to seawater temperature or chlorophyll a (Phytoplankton biomass) which were often observed in similar previous studies. Instead bacterioplankton biomass showed a significant but negative correlation to salinity and density,  i.e., lighter water retained more biomass.  Higher bacterioplankton biomass in a lighter and thus stable surface water column is in general due primarily to the elevated biomass and production of the Phytoplankton. But this mechanism does not seem to hold entirely true in this study since the bacterioplankton biomass is not correlated to the chlorophyll a.  Less saline lighter water might as well imply the riverine input of organic material from the nearby continents.  In addition, large differences of the bacterioplankton biomass across the temperature fronts suggested that the bacterioplankton distributions in the study area were also under the influence of small-scale eddies and physical fronts formed by the temperature or density gradients.</abstract>
