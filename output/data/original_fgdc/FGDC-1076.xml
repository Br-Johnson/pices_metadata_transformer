      <abstract>Project THRUST (Tsunami Hazards Reduction Utilizing Systems Technology) was a demonstration of satellite technology, used with existing tsunami warning
methods, to create a low cost, reliable, local tsunami warning system. The major objectives were successfully realized at the end of the demonstration phase in
September 1987. In June 1988, the Chilean Government held a workshop to assess the value of THRUST to national interests. Two recommendations came forth
from the workshop: (1) the technology was sufficiently reliable and cost-effective to begin the development of an operational prototype and (2) the prototype would
be used as the Chilean Tsunami Warning System. As of August 1989, the equipment was in operational use. In September 1989, major improvements were made in
the satellite operations that reduced the response time from 88 to 17 sec and enlarged the broadcast area by 50%. The implications of the recent improvements in
satellite technology are discussed for application to reductions in disaster impacts.</abstract>
