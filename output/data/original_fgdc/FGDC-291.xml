      <abstract>Interannual changes of temperature and salinity in the core of the warm intermediate layer in the northwest part of the Bering Sea are considered.  In the beginning of the 1950s it was observed the low temperature and the high salinity (the first type), in the 1960s - the high values of temperature and salinity (the second type).  The situation of the 1950s was repeated in the beginning of 1970s and was continued by the middle of 1990s.  From the 1995 the temperature was high, but the salinity was low (the third type).

The first and second types are connected with strengthening of the water exchange with Pacific Ocean, the third type - with its weakening.  The salinity of the intermediate waters in the Bering Sea has the strong dependence on the volume of the entering to the Bering Sea Pacific waters, while the temperature depends on the heat contents of the entering waters.  The change of the typical situation in the intermediate layer happens not at once, but in the process of stable 2-3 year weakening of strengthening of the water exchange.</abstract>
