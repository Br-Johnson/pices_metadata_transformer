      <abstract>Fifteen dives along the Galapagos Ridge in the region between 85°49'W and 85°55'W were made to examine the detailed relationships among tectonics,
hydrothermal activity and lava compositions. Extensive tectonic activity and physical weathering have exposed the inner parts of large Cu-Zn sulfide mounds and the
uppermost part of the underlying stockwork zone. The mineralization occurs at the top and southern base of a horst block, 40 to 80 m high, that separates the
present Neovolcanic Zone to the north from an older rift valley to the south. The lavas in the Neovolcanic Zone are homogeneous MORB pillows; those on the horst
block and within the southern valley are evolved MORB to andesite pillow and sheet flows. The alteration zone exposed beneath the sulfide mounds comprises a
network of fracture-controlled pipe and sheet-like bodies of highly altered material which changes outward into relatively fresh but similarly closely fractured rocks.
The hydrothermal upflow zone is extensively brecciated on a centimeter scale and encloses a stockwork of veinlets now filled largely by silica, clays and sulfides.
The most highly altered rocks are strongly depleted in Ca, Na, K and Mn, and are enriched in S, Fe, Cu and Zn relative to their fresh analogs. Si and Mg are
variable, the latter showing local depletions and enrichments according to the proportion and distribution of chlorite. Depletions in O with increasing Sr/Sr
suggest extensive seawater-rock interaction (W/R up to 100:1) at T up to 350°C. Deep-two and ALVIN-based magnetic profiles have a relative magnetization low
centered over the southern valley and the horst block that could reflect more extensive hydrothermal alteration zones associated with the older seafloor. The Gal
pagos stockwork is most analogous to the alteration zones associated with massive sulfide deposits in the ophiolites of Cyprus and Oman.</abstract>
