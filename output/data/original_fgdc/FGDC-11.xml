        <title>Environmental Variability Facilitates Coexistence within an Acid Community at Sea</title>

      <abstract>We examined coexistence at sea among 7 taxa of diving, wing-propelled seabirds (Alcidae) in the genera Aethia, Uria, Cepphus, and Fratercula. Species abundances were measured simultaneously with a suite of
     environmental factors in the northern Bering Sea, Alaska, USA; data from
     260 adjacent and non-adjacent sites occupied by alcids foraging offshore near
     breeding colonies were then subjected to principal component analysis
     (PCA). We used PCA to group redundant environmental descriptors, to
     identify orthogonal axes for constructing a multi-dimensional niche, and to
     differentiate species associations within niche dimensions from species
     associations among niche dimensions. Decomposition of the correlation matrix
     for 22 environmental and 7 taxonomic variables with PCA gave 14
     components (10 environmental and 4 species interactions) that retained 90%
     of the original available variance. Acid abundances (all species) were most
     strongly correlated with axes representing tidal stage, a time-area interaction
     (due to sampling layout), water masses, and a temporal or intra-seasonal trend
     partially associated with weather changes. Axes representing tidal stage, 2
     gradients in macro-habitat (Anadyr and Bering Shelf Water masses), the
     micro-habitat of the sea surface, and an air-sea interaction were most
     important for detecting differences among species within niche dimensions.
     Contrary to assumptions of competition, none of 4 compound variables
     describing primarily species-interactions gave strong evidence for negative
     associations between acid taxa sharing similar body sizes and feeding
     requirements. This exploratory analysis supports the view that alcids may
     segregate along environmental gradients at sea. But in this community,
     segregation was unrelated to foraging distance from colonies, in part because
     foraging 'substrate' was highly variable in structure, location, and areal extent.
     We contend that coexistence within this seabird group is facilitated via
     expanded niche dimensions created from a complex marine environment.</abstract>
