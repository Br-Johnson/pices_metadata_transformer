        <p>Salmon and other pelagic nekton data collected between September 8 and October 6, 2002 as part of the BASIS survey by the F/V Northwest Explorer.</p>
        <p>A total of 44 rope trawl stations were sampled along the Aleutian chain in the Bering Sea basin or within the proximity of the Aleutian Islands and stations on or adjacent to the Eastern Bering Sea shelf.  Salmon and other pelagic nekton samples were collected with a Cantrawl model 400/580 midwater rope trawl. The Cantrawl trawl had a typical mouth opening of 17 x 45 m with the bridle and door configuration used aboard the Northwest Explorer. All trawling was conducted during daylight (except for the diel stations with the TINRO), and the duration for all trawls was one hour.</p>
        <p>Lengths, weights, scales, maturity, gender (for adult salmon), and genetic samples (either electrophoresis tissues or whole body) were collected from all salmon. Adult salmon stomachs and muscle tissue samples were collected from a subsample of up to 10 individuals per species per station. Lengths and weights were taken from other nekton species (subsamples from large catches). Adult pollock stomachs were preserved in formalin for laboratory analysis, and whole fish samples of other nekton were frozen for further laboratory analysis. All salmon scales and chum salmon otoliths were sent to the Tag, Mark, and Age Laboratory, Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFG) for ageing and thermal mark identification.</p>
