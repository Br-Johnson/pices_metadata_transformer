      <abstract>The Bering Sea supports the largest flatfish fishery in the United States. Productivity in this region is important to the U.S. economy; fisheries from the region constitute 10-40% of the U.S. fisheries harvest. Bottom trawling for flatfish has been common in the Bering Sea since the early 1950s when foreign fishing vessels overexploited yellowfin sole stocks. Mobile fishing gear has recently become the focus of international attention as
managers fear habitat degradation, loss of biological diversity and the subsequent consequences to fishery resources. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSFCMA) requires the identification and description of Essential
Fish Habitat (EFH) for each commercially fished species and any adverse impacts that may affect EFH. However, a paucity of knowledge on trawl impacts on the eastern Bering Sea shelf currently impedes resource managers' ability to address the
requirements of the MSFCMA and make informed decisions in this region. 

In collaboration with the Alaska Fisheries Science Center of the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service, and the Groundfish Forum, we will determine if there are measurable impacts of commercial flatfish trawling on EFH of the eastern Bering Sea shelf. 
Our objectives are to 1) compare physical and biological variables between trawled areas and closures to determine chronic impacts 2) conduct experimental trawling in selected closures to determine acute trawling impacts by comparing physical and biological variables 3) determine the severity of trawl impacts compared to natural variation at different depths and substrates across the eastern Bering Sea shelf.
