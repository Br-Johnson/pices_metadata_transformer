      <abstract>The eastern Bering Sea continental slope region contains many
                        Groundfish species that are important to the Bering Sea ecosystem.
                        Several studies have described the food habits of these species in
                        the eastern Bering Sea shelf region, however few studies have
                        been conducted for the slope region. Consequently, the food
                        habits of the major Groundfish in this region are poorly understood.
                        The focus of this study was to identify the trophic interactions of
                        walleye Pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), Pacific cod (Gadus
                        macrocephalus), Greenland turbot (Reinhardtius
                        hippoglossoides), arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias),
                        and flathead sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon) in the slope region
                        of the eastern Bering Sea. Stomach contents of 1,089 walleye
                        Pollock, 311 Pacific cod, 455 Greenland halibut, 282 arrowtooth
                        flounder, and 366 flathead sole were examined. The general diet
                        of each species is described and dietary variation due to predator
                        size, depth, season, and latitude within the slope region are
                        examined. Walleye Pollock are known to be the most important
                        prey fish in the eastern Bering Sea shelf region. In the slope region,
                        species from the families Bathylagidae and Myctophidae were
                        found, in addition to Pollock, to be important forage fish of
                        Groundfish predators.</abstract>
