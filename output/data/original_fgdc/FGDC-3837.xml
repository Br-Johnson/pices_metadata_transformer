        <p>The assumption is generally made that salmon in the ocean consume prey heavily in the summer and fall and, therefore, the lipid level in the muscle of these fish would be high during both these seasons of the year. This study is the first to report the total lipid (TL) content in the white muscle of chum salmon by age group from fish caught in the international waters of the Bering Sea in summer (June and July) and fall (September). The TL was extracted from the white muscle of 491 immature chum salmon using chloroform and methanol and the lipid was measured by weight after evaporation of the solvents. Young chum salmon (age 0.1) caught during the summer contained significantly lower TL (t-test; df=226, p≤0.001) than fish of the same age caught during the fall. In summer the mean TL in the muscle of age 0.1 female (n=21) and male (n=27) chum salmon was low (1.8% for both sexes). However, in fall the mean TL contained in age 0.1 female (n=92) and male (n=88) fish increased substantially (7.5% and 7.1%, respectively). A previous study hypothesized that young (age 0.1) chum salmon would have a relatively low TL content in summer because fish are growing quickly at the expense of lipid storage at this time of year. It was further hypothesized that in the fall, growth rate would decrease and lipid storage increase to promote the fishﾒs survival through the winter when food rations may be severely limited. Results of this study provide evidence of a seasonal shift in lipid storage during summer and fall for young chum salmon in the ocean. Continued monitoring of immature chum salmon for lipid levels is recommended for surveys conducted throughout the year.</p>
