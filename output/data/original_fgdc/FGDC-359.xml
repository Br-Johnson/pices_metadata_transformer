      <abstract>Marine mammals are vital to the subsistence lifestyle and economy of coastal Alaska Natives. In 1988, six coastal Alaska Native regions formed the Alaska Sea Otter Commission to restore Alaska Native governance over the northern sea otter. In November 1998, the Commission expanded its role as a statewide organization to advocate on behalf of Steller sea lion and Alaska Native relationships. The organization officially expanded to The Alaska Sea Otter&amp; Steller Sea Lion Commission (TASSC). In 1992, the Commission developed regional management plans for each of its six regions. Recognized within these plans is a need for local participation in research and management. Research includes building regional capacity by training local residents on the methods of biological sampling of the northern sea otter. In 1995, the Commission received funding to implement a biological training program. Over 55 local people from within the six coastal regions received training. To date, 185 biological samples from subsistence harvested sea otters were collected for research. This project expands the biological sampling program to train local people on marine mammal and bird stranding protocols.
