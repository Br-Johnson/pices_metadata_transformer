      <abstract>Recent climate records from ice cores and deep-sea sediments suggest that
        there has been considerable climate variability in the North Atlantic region
        over the past 250,000 years. Much of this variability may be linked to changes
        in thermohaline circulation in the North Atlantic ocean. Model studies have
        demonstrated that changes in the flux of fresh water to the ocean, resulting
        from changes in atmospheric transport or the waxing and waning of ice sheets,
        can have a significant effect on the thermohaline circulation. The authors
        present model simulations showing that increased flow of fresher North Pacific
        water through the Bering Strait into the northern North Atlantic can also
        effect the thermohaline circulation, by suppressing North Atlantic Deep Water
        formation; however, decreased flow does not necessarily cause deep-water
        formation to begin again. In the model, flow through the Bering Strait
        depends on ecstatic sea level and the salinity difference between the North
        Atlantic and North Pacific oceans. The authors suggest that a higher sea level
        during the last interglacial period, leading to greater flow through the Bering
        Strait, may have made the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation more
        sensitive than it is at present to fluctuations in the hydrological cycle, which
        may explain recent observations indicating that climate variability was greater
        then than it is today.</abstract>
