      <abstract>Two surveys for Zooplankton community study were carried out during summer 1995 and 1995 in the Bering Sea international zone and in the Bogoslof Island region.  Zooplankton were collected with a Bongo net (mouth diameter 60cm, mesh 330mu) 49 stations during the period from 20 June 1994 to 10 July 1994 and at 44 stations during the period from 7 July 1995 to 28 July 1995.  Zooplankton abundance varied from 55 to 1,360 indiv*m (-3) in 1994 and from 24.1 to 2,481 indiv*m (-3) in 1995 respectively.  Copepods were the major components of the epipelagic Zooplankton during the study periods.  Densities of copepods ranged 42~1,336 indiv*m (03) in 1994 and 5~2,466 indiv*m (-3) in 1995.  Chaetognaths, amphipods, polychaetes ostracods and appendicularians were also important components of the zooplankton community.  Species composition of Zooplankton in 1994 was similar to that in 1995.  Dominant species in this study area were large copepods such as Eucalanus bungii, Neocalanus crisatus and Metridia pacific and small species such as Pseudocalanus spp. And Acarta longiremis.  Zooplankton abundances were higher in the Bogoslof regions than those in the open ocean in 1994, while they were higher in the open sea than in the slope near the Bogoslof regions in 1995.  It seems that higher zooplankton abundances in 1995 than in 1994 was due to an increase of the Phytoplankton due to the higher water temperature and decrease of the predators such as walleye pollock.</abstract>
