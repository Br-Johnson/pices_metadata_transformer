      <abstract>Almost anyone who loves mushrooms has probably wondered what it would be like to pick them in the wild. The best way to start is to go with people who know what they're
doing. As science writer Sonya Senkowsky reports in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio, Alaska mushroom hunters have begun harvesting morels, a type of mushroom that grows especially well in burned forests.</abstract>
      <purpose>Two years ago, Eklutna, Alaska, landowner Larry Traw had a series of nasty surprises. First, a wildfire burned some 400 acres of forest around his home. Then, state and
federal officials tried to hold him responsible for the blaze, saying it most likely started when he was burning brush in his backyard. Finally, he was slapped with a one-million-dollar fire-fighting bill, the largest ever charged to a private andowner.

Could there possibly be a bright side to this story? Traw says there was. For at the same time his legal battle was beginning, popping up among the ash was another surprise, this one much nicer: a fresh crop of Alaska morels.</purpose>
