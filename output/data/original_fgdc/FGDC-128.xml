      <abstract>Four years (1 January 1973 through 31 December 1976) of Arctic and
Antarctic sea ice conditions, derived from Nimbus-5 Electrically
Scanning Microwave Radiometer (ESMR) brightness temperatures (TB), are
mapped on polar stereographic grids enclosing the 50 degree north and
50 degree south latitude circles. Grid size varies from about 32 by 32
km at the poles to about 28 by 28 km at 50 degrees. Sea ice
concentrations were calculated from TBs for each grid point with an
algorithm that uses an emissivity value of 0.92 and an ice physical
temperature estimate from climatological surface air temperatures.

Monthly, multiyear monthly and yearly grids of TB's and sea ice
concentrations were created for 1973-1976, except for seven months for
which usable data were insufficient.  Three-day averaged TB grids are
also available for both hemispheres (two tapes per hemisphere.)  Data
produced by H.J. Zwally, C.L. Parkinson, J.C. Comiso, all of
NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center.  Published atlases for Arctic and
Antarctic are available (NASA SP-489, 1987 and NASA-SP-459, 1983,
respectively.)  Data available via ftp, or can be packaged on 4mm or
8mm tape; data reports provided with data orders.</abstract>
