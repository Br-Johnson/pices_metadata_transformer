      <abstract>Regional and vertical differences in abundance and developmental stages of Oikopleura vanhoeffeni Lohmann within the Bering Shelf Water were studied for the summers of 1983 and 1986. The population in the northeast of St. Lawrence Island was exclusively composed of juveniles 2-4 mm in tail length, while in the south of the island, both adults longer than 14 mm in tail length and juveniles coexisted. Adults and juveniles were vertically separated: the adults were in the deeper layer while the juveniles were in the upper one. This evidence suggests that spawning of O. vanhoeffeni may take place in the south of St. Lawrence Island. Most of the juvenile population is probably transported to the north of Bering Strait along a frontal zone between the Bering Shelf Water and the Alaskan Coastal Water.</abstract>
