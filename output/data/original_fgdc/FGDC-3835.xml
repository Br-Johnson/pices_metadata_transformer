        <p>DNA microarray was used for rapid and accurate identification of 30 haplotypes of the mitochondrial (mt) DNA control region of chum salmon to estimate stock composition of mixture fish caught in the central Bering Sea and adjacent North Pacific Ocean during R/V Kaiyo maru cruise in September 2002 and 2003. The mtDNA baseline included 48 populations around the Pacific Rim. A simulation study suggested only three regions (Japan, Russia, and North America) are discriminated using the present mt DNA baseline, while some haplotypes are useful for stock identification of individual fish. The estimated stock compositions of mixtures are different among areas and also among sampling years. The estimates suggested that Asian stocks were dominant at most survey areas of the central Bering Sea (52-58°N, 172°W-172°E). The estimated Russian contributions were higher in 2002 (21-68%) than 2003 (16-50%), and the component of Japanese stock was 15-77% in 2002 and 15-63% in 2003. In the North Pacific Ocean, the estimated percentage of North American stock was 72-75% in 165°W line but only 7-23% in waters west of 180°. Further baseline data of other variable DNA regions as well as mtDNA control region should be accumulated for more fine-scale stock identification.</p>
