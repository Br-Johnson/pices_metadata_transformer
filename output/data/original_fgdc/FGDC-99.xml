      <abstract>Oregon, Washington, and Alaska (defined in this report as the
                        Pacific Northwest) exports of edible fishery products in 1993
                        declined 4.7% in quantity from 1992 to 1.49 billion pounds (lb) or
                        676,272 metric tons (t). The value of these fishery exports
                        declined by 16.2% to $2.15 billion. Although there were declines
                        in exports of Groundfish, salmon, crab, and herring, the decrease in
                        total exports was primarily due to the 25% decline in Groundfish
                        exports and the 10.5% decline in salmon exports. In 1993,
                        Groundfish exports of $833 million and salmon exports of $798
                        million accounted for 38.7 and 37%, respectively, of the total
                        value of Pacific Northwest fishery exports. The value of Pacific
                        Northwest exports comprised 72.7% of total U.S. edible fishery
                        exports, down from 76.6% in 1992. In 1993, Pacific Northwest
                        exports were shipped to 37 countries with the top 4 countries
                        accounting for 94% of the total. Except for increased trade with
                        Canada and the People's Republic of China, trade of fishery
                        products declined with the major importing countries (Japan,
                        Republic of Korea, the United Kingdom, France, and Australia).
                        Exports to Japan totaled $1.7 billion or 79.7% of the total, down
                        16.7% in value from $2.06 billion in 1992. Canada jumped to the
                        second spot with shipments increasing by nearly 50% to $142
                        million or 6.6% of total exports. The Republic of Korea slipped to
                        the third spot with $98 million or 4.6% of the total exports, down
                        22.8% from $127 million in 1992. Pacific Northwest exports to
                        the United Kingdom dropped 38.5% from 1992 to $77 million or
                        3.6% of the total exports.</abstract>
