      <abstract>Data Type: Boundaries; This is a composite land ownership/land status layer based primarily on the Chugach National Forest (CNF) land status GIS database and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land records (as processed into a GIS format by Alaska Department of Natural Resources (DNR)). The CNF database includes owner, status and parcel boundaries for all lands within the CNF boundary. These parcel boundaries are based on legal descriptions, plats, and other sources drafted onto 1:31,680 scale base maps. Pacific GIS used land status records from Alaska DNR for areas outside the CNF boundary (primarily the Copper River basin). The DNR dataset is coarser in resolution (i.e., to the nearest section) than the datasets available through the Chugach NF. Alaska DNR bases their understanding of land status on a statewide digital (but non- geographic) database maintained by the BLM. In general, these records are thematically accurate but do not carry specific parcel boundaries. At a regional level of analysis, the coarse nature of this data is acceptable, but the user should recognize this limitations of this source data. Land ownership and status is dynamic, particularly in Alaska, where land is still being transferred from federal to state and Native corporation ownership, and from state to private ownership under the Alaska Statehood Act, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, and various state homestead and land disposal programs. Due to the many and frequent changes in land ownership and status, Pacific GIS recommends obtaining updated information from the source agencies.</abstract>
