      <abstract>The surface temperature field in the Arctic winter is primarily controlled by
     downward longwave radiation, which is determined by local atmospheric
     temperature and humidity profiles and the presence of clouds. The authors
     show that regional differences in the atmospheric thermal energy budget are
     related to the tropospheric circulation in the Arctic. Data sources include
     several gridded meteorological datasets and surface and rawinsonde
     observational data. Four independent climatologies of mean January surface
     temperature show consistent spatial patterns: coldest temperatures in the
     western Arctic north of Canada and warmer regions in the Chukchi,
     Greenland, and Barents Seas. Data from the five winters of 1986ﾖ90
     illustrate the coupling between the surface temperature, the downward
     longwave radioactive fields, and the tropospheric temperature and humidity
     fields, with monthly surfaceﾖupper-air correlation on the order of 0.6.
     Upper-level circulation patterns reveal features similar to the surface
     temperature fields, notably a persistent low center located over northern
     Canada; the cyclonic flow around the low is a tropospheric extension of the
     polar vortex. Colder and drier conditions are maintained within the vortex
     and communicated to the surface through radioactive processes. The polar
     vortex also steers transient weather systems, the most important mechanism
     for horizontal heat transport, into the eastern Arctic, which results in as much
     as 25 W m2 more heat flux into the eastern Arctic than the western Arctic.
     A reason for the colder temperatures in the western Arctic is that the polar
     vortex tends to be situated downstream of the northern Rocky Mountains;
     this preferred location is related to orographic forcing of planetary waves.
     Monthly and interannual variability of winter temperatures is conditioned by
     the interaction of the Arctic and midlatitude circulations through the strength
     and position of the polar vortex.</abstract>
