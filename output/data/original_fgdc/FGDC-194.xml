      <abstract>Observational data in the upper ocean of the deep Bering Sea (the Aleutian Basin) in July 1994 and July 1995 are analyzed and discussed.  It is shown that four water masses dominate in the region during the surveys: the warm and low saline waters at the thin sea surface layer induced by solar heating the minimum temperature waters between 100 and 150m in the northwestern part of the Aleutian Basin which are present as a result of local winter cooling and subsequent spring warming, the low salinity waters in depths above 200m originated from the northeastern continental shelf area, and relatively warm subsurface waters in the area west for the Aleutian Islands which come from the west along the Islands or result from inflow of the Alaskan Stream through Amukta Pass.  These water masses meet in the eastern corner of the Aleutian Basin and this suggests that meso-scale phenomena such as eddies,  which play an important role on fisheries are well developed there.   The data reveal that the water are warmer about 3 C and fresher about 0.8 psi in July 1995 than in July 1994, though the general pattern of water property distribution is very similar.  Such a large difference in a year especially in temperature,  may be unrealistic and raised a question, however.</abstract>
