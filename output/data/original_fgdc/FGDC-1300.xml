        <p>Bottom trawling effects are being studied in a shallow, soft-bottom area of the eastern Bering Sea.  In 2001, twelve 10-mile long research corridors were surveyed before and after trawling with commercial gear.  To investigate the recovery process, these same corridors were resampled in 2002 during a 21-day cruise aboard the chartered fishing vessel Ocean Explorer.  Once again, surface-living organisms (epifauna), surficial sediments, and organisms living in the sediments (infauna) were sampled using research trawls and van Veen grab samplers.  A high-resolution side scan sonar system was also deployed to study possible changes in physical characteristics of the seafloor as a result of trawling.  A multidisciplinary team of scientists, technicians, and fishers from government, university, military, and industry sectors is working collaboratively on the study.</p>
        <p>Upon completion of the bottom trawl study, a reconnaissance survey of Bristol Bay habitats was undertaken using the Klein 5410 side- scan sonar.  This system is new technology that not only produces extremely high-resolution images of the seafloor, but also simultaneously gathers swath bathymetry data using interferometry.  Approximately 1 megabyte (MB) of data are collected each second.  Prior to deployments in Alaska, the research team developed an improved software interface during laboratory testing and sea trials in Portsmouth Harbor, New Hampshire, and Puget Sound, Washington.  The reconnaissance effort was centered on an 800 mi2 area of central Bristol Bay that has never been hydrographically surveyed by NOAA.  Bathymetric data and imagery were collected along survey lines totaling nearly 600 linear miles.  In support of coordinated Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) characterization studies in the area, the reconnaissance survey intentionally crossed 18 RACE Division trawl survey stations and followed 78 mi of seabed previously classified using a QTC View single beam acoustic system.  The survey also intersected six of the trawl study corridors (above) in order to provide a spatial context for these experimental results.  Overall, a great diversity of complex sand-bedforms and other geological features were encountered in the survey area.</p>
