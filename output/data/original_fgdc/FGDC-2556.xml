        <p>Author and title of this book: Great Britain Admiralty, List of Oceanic Depths and Serial Temperature Observations</p>
        <p>Call number: C/L G78h-L 21689</p>
        <p>This book is a part of the foreign meteorological data collection held by the NOAA Central Library in Washington, DC.  Information in this collection dates back to the 18th century for daily, monthly, seasonal, and annual tabular summaries, and the 19th century for weather maps. These data are the result of foreign exchange agreements, but the collection has not been updated since 1983.</p>
        <p>
          In these summaries, definitions are:
          <br />
          1.   Hourly/daily/monthly/seasonal/annual data -- values determined for each consecutive period, e.g. monthly temperature data: Jan 1900, Feb 1900, etc.
          <br />
          2.   Long-term data -- values determined over a period of years, e.g. long-term monthly temperature data using Jan 1901, Jan 1902, etc.
        </p>
        <p>This book contains tables of daily deep sea sounding and surface and subsurface temperature for the North Atlantic Ocean, South Pacific Ocean, and China Sea for various periods between 1893 and 1898.</p>
        <p>
          Tables include the following data:
          <br />
          - daily deep sea sounding (includes surface and bottom temperature)
          <br />
          - daily observations of the nature of sea bottom.
