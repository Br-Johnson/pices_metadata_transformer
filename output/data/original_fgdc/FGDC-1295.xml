        <p>The Bering Sea Resource Assessment group completed its annual shelf crab-groundfish bottom trawl survey during 29 May - 1 August 2002.  This yearﾒs survey was performed aboard the chartered fishing vessels Arcturus and Aldebaran.  This marks the 10th consecutive survey using these vessels.</p>
        <p>Temperatures were warmer than the long-term mean from 1982.  Mean bottom temperature was 3.27EC, compared to the long-term value of 2.44EC.  Surface temperature values were closer, with this yearﾒs mean of 6.88EC and the long-term mean of 6.58EC.</p>
        <p>A total of 393 stations were sampled, including 18 special stations from inner Bristol Bay, to continue our evaluation of yellowfin sole spawning populations during the sampling period.  Abundance estimates for the major species showed few unexpected changes from 2001.</p>
        <p>Walleye pollock, as expected from the indication of incoming recruits during 2001, was up slightly in 2002 to 4.8 million metric tons (t).  Pacific cod was one of the few surprises, with a decrease from 830,000 t in 2001 down to 616,000 t this year.  Cod had been decreasing steadily over a several year period until  an upturn in 2001.</p>
        <p>Among the flatfish species, yellowfin sole and flathead sole were slightly higher in abundance in 2002.  Northern rock sole, Alaska plaice, arrowtooth flounder, and Greenland turbot were all down, but none significantly.</p>
        <p>After the survey, two important experiments were completed.  The first step in a year-long series of survey experiments between the AFSCﾒs Kodiak Laboratory and the ADF&amp;#38;G was completed to examine life history characteristics of snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio).  These collections were made near St. Matthew Island and near the Pribilof Islands and included the collection of live animals for transfer to the Kodiak Laboratory.</p>
        <p>The second experiment took place in Bristol Bay and examined the escapement of  red king crab (Paralithodes camschaticus) under the footrope of the 83-112 trawl used in the annual Bering Sea surveys.  The study is extremely important in the development of abundance estimates.  Results will be reported at a later time.</p>
