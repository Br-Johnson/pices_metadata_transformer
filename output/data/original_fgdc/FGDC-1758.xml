      <abstract>Based on the China-Japan cooperation from 1997-2000, a 7-component physical-biological-chemical coupled numerical model was developed in two steps.  First, following two marine mesocosm experiments in the Yangtse River estuary area in October 1997 and May 1998, a 1-D biological chemical mode, which includes nitrogen, phosphate, silicon, flagellate, diatom and detritus, was created, and the model results were compared with in situ data.  Second, zooplankton was added to the above model, and the model was combined with a 3-D physical model of Jiaozhou Bay.  Located 400 km from Qingdao, this bay is one of two marine ecosystem stations in China.  With this 3-D 7-component coupled model, 4 years of observations were simulated and compared with observations at 10 stations in the bay.
