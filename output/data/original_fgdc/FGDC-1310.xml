      <abstract>During the third quarter of 2002, 194 observers were trained, briefed, and equipped for deployment to fishing and processing vessels and shoreside plants in the Gulf of Alaska, Bering Sea, and Aleutian Islands.  They sampled aboard 227 fishing and processing vessels and at 14 shoreside processing plants.  These observers were trained or briefed in various locations.  The University of Alaska Anchorage Observer Training Center trained 25 first time observers and briefed another 59 observers with prior experience.  The AFSC Observer Program in Seattle trained 20 first-time observers and briefed another 67 observers who had prior experience.  Twenty-three observers were excused from briefing because they had just completed a cruise successfully and were returning immediately to the field.  The third quarter 2002 observer workforce thus comprised 23% new observers and 77% experienced observers. 

The Observer Program conducted a total of 110 debriefings during the second quarter of 2002. Thirty-three debriefings were held in Anchorage, 1 in Kodiak, and another 75 in Seattle.
