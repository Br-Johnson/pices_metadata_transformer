        <p>The Wakatake maru (666 gross tons) departed Kushiro on June 8, 2002 and returned on July 21, 2002. There were 28 experimental fishing stations during the cruise. Nineteen fishing stations were located in the vicinity of 180º longitude from 41ºN to 58º30ﾒN latitude, and nine operations were conducted in the international waters of the central Bering Sea.</p>
        <p>Chlorophyll samples were collected at 19 fishing stations (St. 3-21) along a south to north transect and at 12 transit stations located at an interval of 5º longitude (Table 1). A bucket was used to collect a surface water sample of which 100-ml was filtered through a 25-mm glass-fiber filter (Whatman GF/F) using a vacuum pump (100-120 mm Hg). Filters containing the chlorophyll-a were soaked with 6 ml of N-dimethylformaide and kept in the freezer.</p>
