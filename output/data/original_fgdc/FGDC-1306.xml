        <p>During the last 2 weeks of July 2002, NMML biologists used the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service vessel Surfbird  as a platform from which to capture harbor seals. The Surfbird anchored in Gambier Bay and Seymour Canal (~ 50 miles south of Juneau) near known aggregations of seals. Biologists used inflatable boats to deploy tangle nets near haulouts and to capture animals resting on the beach. Captured seals were weighed, measured, and tagged with radio transmitters. Automated receiving stations were deployed nearby to monitor each sealﾒs frequency on a regular schedule to determine daily patterns of haul-out behavior. Data will be downloaded from these stations and the stations disassembled in mid-October. Meteorological data were collected using a weather station deployed near the haulouts. Haul-out behavior will be related to the environmental covariates so that an adjustment can be applied to the aerial survey counts which were initiated 1 week after seal tagging.</p>
