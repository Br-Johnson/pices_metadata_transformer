      <abstract>In August 1991, satellite-linked platform transmitter terminals
                        (PTTs) were attached to four spotted seals (Phoca largha)
                        captured near a coastal haul out at Utukok Pass in the
                        northeastern Chukchi Sea. The locations and diving behavior of
                        the seals were monitored for periods of 64-259 days. Usable
                        position information was obtained for about 50% of the days that
                        the PTTs were operational. During August-October, seals made
                        long feeding trips southwestward into the southern Chukchi Sea
                        and returned to haul outs at Kasegaluk Lagoon. Durations of
                        at-sea periods ranged from 8 to 902 hours, and the four seals on
                        average spent 7% of their time hauled out. Three seals with still
                        functional PTTs began their southward migration in October; two
                        of them used haul outs in the Kotzebue Sound region and the
                        northern Seward Peninsula. Seals migrated southward through
                        Bering Strait in November and were near St. Lawrence Island in
                        mid-December. The two seals whose PTTs worked into
                        March-April spent the late winter and early spring in the sea ice
                        south and southeast of St. Matthew Island. Haul outs on ice were
                        infrequent, with seals hauled out only 6% of the time, on average.
                        The number of dives to greater than 10 m depth averaged 160 and
                        284 per day for two of the seals. All dives were to depths less
                        than 100 m, and most lasted for less than 10 minutes.

                        This study demonstrated the utility of satellite-linked telemetry for
                        studying the biology of spotted seals. Modifications to PTT
                        programming should allow future efforts to gather more detailed
                        information on movements and diving behavior.</abstract>
