        <p>Sea Surface Temperature, Wave Height and Period</p>
        <p>Measurement Details: 16 offshore, coastal and inshore moored buoys with on-board data loggers and telemetry via GOES; onboard calculation of significant wave height and peak period. Various starting dates, beginning as early as 1988.</p>
        <p>Publication: "Technical details on data processing, calibration etc are available in ""Meteorological and Oceanographic Measurements from Canadian Weather Buoys - a Review of Sensors, Data Reduction, Transmission, Quality Control and Archival Methods"", 1996. Prepared by Axys Environmental Consulting Ltd. for Environment Canada. Copy in IOS Library Technical Records."</p>
        <p>IOSPBS Data Distribution: Historical have been assembled from various sources (MEDS and PWC) and are available at IOS. [Share_data disk: \METBUOY]. Real-time data are received at IOS and eventually replaced by data from AES that has been through their QC/QA procedures.</p>
        <p>PSARC_Utility: Data are archived at their original sampling interval (hourly). There have been subjected to AES quality control, but there are gaps in the data due to sensor or system failures. We have not assembled daily or monthly summaries of these data. Real time data (unverified by AES) are available at IOS.</p>
        <p>Improvements: "Data are archived at their original sampling interval (hourly). There have been subjected to AES quality control, but there are gaps in the data due to sensor or system failures. We have not assembled daily or monthly summaries of these data. Real time data (unverified by AES) are available at IOS. Some additional work is required to merge data formats (particularly ""time"" coding). Processes could be developed to automatically generate daily and monthly summary files, which are likely to be more relevant for stock assessment use.   In addition, we could attempt to reconstruct the time series BACK in time by extracting data at these locations from the COADS or REYNOLDS datasets."</p>
