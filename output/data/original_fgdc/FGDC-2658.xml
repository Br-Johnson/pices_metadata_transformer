      <abstract>The distribution and elemental composition of suspended particulate matter in Norton Sound and the northeastern Bering Sea shelf were studied in July 1979. Samples were analyzed for total suspended matter and particulate C, N, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, In, Cu, and Zn. The results show that the bulk of suspended material in Norton Sound consists of sedimentary material discharged from the Yukon River and re-suspended bottom sediments. The Yukon River material enters the sound from the southwest, is transported north and northeast around the perimeter of the sound, and exits from the northwest. The concentrations of the major and trace elements in the particulate matter and their elemental ratios with aluminum indicate that: K, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, In, and Cu are primarily associated with aluminosilicate material derived from the Yukon River and re-suspended sediments, and C and N are primarily associated with terrestrial organic material in estuarine samples and marine organic material in offshore samples. Significant enrichments of Mn and Zn, observed in the offshore samples, are attributed to Mn recycling in the sediments followed by precipitation of Mn onto particulate phases in the water column, with the Mn oxyhydroxides scavenging Zn.</abstract>
