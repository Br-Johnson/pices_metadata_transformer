      <abstract>
        SEASAT was launched on June 28, 1978, carrying a five sensor payload, and operated successfully until a power failure brought transmission to a stop on
        <p>October 10, 1978.  Its height and inclination were 791km and 108.0ﾡ, respectively. The Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) is a passive microwave radiometer measuring dual polarized microwave radiation from the earth's surface and atmosphere in 5 frequencies: 6.63, 10.69, 18.0, 21.0 and 37.0 ghz.  SMMR swath width is 600 km.  Global coverage was achieved within the orbital extremes: +77/-72ﾡ latitude from July 7 through August 17, 1978, with a ground track equatorial spacing of 165 km.  From August 18 through October 10, 1978, (the date that SEASAT terminally malfunctioned), the ground track equatorial spacing was 900 km.  From July 7 to August 26, 1978, the ground track was repeated once every 3 days.</p>
        <p>The measurement temporal resolution is 10/second.  This data set contains level 1.0 data consisting of decommutated earth-located information about the intensity of radiation emitted from the sea in a microwave band in engineering units (watts, volts). 
Output is in the form of sensor data record tapes.</p>
