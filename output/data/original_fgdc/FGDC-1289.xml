      <abstract>Japan relies on nuclear power for 30 percent of its electricity needs. By contrast, about 20 percent of the electricity produced in the United States comes from nuclear power. What to do with the radioactive waste generated by nuclear power plants has long been a problem for scientists. Japanﾒs solution is to ship spent uranium fuel to England and France, where itﾒs reprocessed and used to generate yet more power. But as Doug Schneider reports in this weekﾒs Arctic Science Journeys Radio, a plan to ship these radioactive materials through the Arctic Ocean is drawing concern among people living in the Arctic.</abstract>
      <purpose>On January 19, the armed British freighter Pintail left the French port of Cherbourg loaded with MOX fuel, a mixture of highly radioactive plutonium and uranium oxide. The ship rounded Africa's Cape Horn this week and will pass between New Zealand and Australia before arriving in Japan in late March, where Japanese officials say the fuel will be fed into a nuclear reactor. 

Earlier shipments of MOX fuel from Europe, as well as nuclear waste from Japan, have raised concern among some 50 countries along the ship's route.

Now, under a plan being negotiated between the Japanese government and Russia's Murmansk Shipping Company, future such shipments would go through the Arctic, where presumably there are fewer people to protest. Apparently, no one considered George Ahmaogak, mayor of the North Slope Borough in Barrow,  Alaska, a community of Inupiat Eskimos along Alaska's Arctic Ocean coast.</purpose>
