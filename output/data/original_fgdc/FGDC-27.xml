      <abstract>The authors computed the occurrence frequency of synoptic-scale disturbances
     over the western tropical Pacific with a simple synoptic scheme and the Goddard
     Earth Observing System data for 1980ﾖ94 supplemented by the 1979 National
     Meteorological Center (currently the National Centers for Environmental
     Prediction) data. The major occurrence of these disturbances exists along the
     monsoon trough with maximum occurrence frequency over Micronesia. The
     occurrence frequency distribution undergoes an interannual variation through the
     influence of large-scale circulation during boreal summer. As a part of the
     interannual variation of large-scale summer circulation in the Pacific basin, a major
     anomalous anticyclonic (cyclonic) circulation cell emerges in the western
     subtropical Pacific (north of 15°N), and a minor anomalous cyclonic
     (anticyclonic) circulation cell appears in the western tropical Pacific (south of
     15°N) during warm (cold) summers. The tropical synoptic-scale disturbance
     activity is affected by these anomalous summer circulations in the following two
     ways: 1) the maximum occurrence frequency appears east (west) of 150°E (the
     east end of the climatological monsoon trough) during warm (cold) summers, and
     2) tropical synoptic-scale disturbances are located primarily south of 15°N during
     warm summers, while their occurrences are enhanced north of 15°N during cold
     summers. Since the effort made here is a pilot study, the authors suggest some
     potential investigations of tropical synoptic-scale disturbances and interannual
     variations of large-scale summer circulation.</abstract>
