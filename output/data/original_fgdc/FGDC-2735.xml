      <abstract>Because of the controversy over the effects of surface wave motion on current records, we have compared summer and winter M tidal current speeds measured by Aandera current meters on subsurface moorings from several locations on the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea continental shelf. Seasonal differences were slight and in most cases not significantly correlated with observed mean wave height measured at Buoy EB-03. We conclude that the seasonally averaged low frequency currents measured by Aanderaa current meters on moorings with the float at least 18 m below the surface were not seriously contaminated by surface-wave-induced mooring motion.</abstract>
