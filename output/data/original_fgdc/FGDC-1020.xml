      <abstract>The causal links between magmatic/tectonic processes and hydrothermal venting along the mid-ocean ridge axis will be difficult to discern
without broadband observations of the temporal variability of hydrothermal activity. I report here on temporal variability in the intensity
and distribution of chronic and event plumes generated by continuous and episodic hydrothermal discharge at two vent fields on the Cleft
segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge. Hydrothermal temperature () and light attenuation (c) anomalies were comprehensively mapped
between 1 and 4 times per year during nine cruises from 1986 to 1991. Intensity of  and c in the chronic plume overlying the north
Cleft vent field showed more variability between years than within a given year. Both  and c were exceptionally high in 1986, fell to
moderate levels during 1988 to 1990, and declined to minimum values in 1991. The chronic plume over the south Cleft vent field varied
similarly. Superimposed on the chronic plumes were brief and intense releases of hydrothermal fluid that created event plumes
distinguishable by their symmetry and exceptional rise height. Event plumes at the north Cleft field ranged from the 1986 megaplume, with
a rise height exceeding 1000 m, to smaller events in 1987 and 1989 with rise heights of ~400 m. Chronic hydrothermal heat (660 ﾱ 277
(1) MW) and mass (204 ﾱ 86 (1) g s) fluxes from the north Cleft field were determined by assuming these fluxes were equivalent to
the long-term net advection of a mean cross-section of the vertically integrated  and c in the plume. This 6-year history of hydrothermal
plumes indicates that episodic discharge has been an important component of the recent hydrothermal flux and that the aggregate heat and
mass fluxes declined significantly, though not consistently, between 1986 and 1991.</abstract>
