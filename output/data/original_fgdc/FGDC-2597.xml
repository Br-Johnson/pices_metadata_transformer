        <p>Publication Title: The climate of Asia (pub.1964).</p>
        <p>In Japanese.  Includes a guide booklet in English.  Consists of two parts: Part I giving detailed accounts of the climate of the whole Asia excluding Japan and Part II presenting comprehensive tables of climatic data for the whole Asia, which were collected from 917 observing sites including 12 in Japan.  Includes supplements of Climatic Tables of Japan, Temperature of sea water in the Asian area, bibliographical guide to climatological data, and indexes.</p>
        <p>In Part I are 6 chapters (Introduction, China and its neighborhood, Southeast Asia, Indo-Pakistan area, West Asia and the Asian area of USSR) detailed by "figures" 1-176 and 29  tables, which include ordinary distribution maps of several climatic factors and incorporate the results of the recent dynamic climatological researches.</p>
        <p>The major features of the climatic tables in Part II are extremes and frequencies of several weather phenomena such as temperature, rain, snow, hail, gale, etc., whereas the ordinary schemes published hitherto give only the mean values of temperature and precipitation.  Another distinctive feature is an unprecedented large number of the stations, which well represent the whole areas of Asia.  The period of time covered by these statistics ranges mainly from 1931 to 1960, which is the period now in use for international normals.</p>
