      <abstract>When an American wheat farmer loses his crop to a flood or drought, insurance he purchased from the federal government helps cushion the blow. As Doug Schneider
reports in this weekﾒs Arctic Science Journeys Radio, Alaskaﾒs beleaguered salmon fishermen may soon be able to insure their "crop" against disaster as well.</abstract>
      <purpose>Alaska is famous for salmon runs that set records one year, only to plummet the next. It's a natural boom-and-bust cycle about which fishermen have long complained, but until now couldn't really do anything about. That may soon change, as the U.S. Department of  Agriculture the same agency that helps farmers insure their crops against locusts, droughts, floods, and other disasters looks to offer insurance to salmon fishermen in
Alaska's Bristol Bay. Mark Herrmann is a fisheries economist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.</purpose>
