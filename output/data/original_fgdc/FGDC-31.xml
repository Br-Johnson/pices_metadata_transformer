      <abstract>A new method for the physical retrieval of rain rates from satellite microwave
     radiometers is presented. The method is part of a unified ocean parameter
     retrieval algorithm that is based on the fundamental principles of radioactive transfer.
     The algorithm simultaneously finds near-surface wind speed W, columnar water
     vapor V, columnar cloud liquid water L, rain rate R, and effective radiating
     temperature TU for the upwelling radiation. Comparisons with radiosondes
     demonstrate that the algorithm is able to retrieve water vapor when rain is present.
     For rain rates from 1 to 15 mm h1, the rms difference between the retrieved
     water vapor and the radiosonde value is 5 mm. A novel feature of the rain
     retrieval method is a beamfilling correction that is based upon the ratio of the
     retrieved liquid water absorption coefficients at 37 and 19 GHz. This spectral
     ratio decreases by about 40% when heavy and light rain coexist within the SSM/I
     footprint as compared to the case of uniform rain. This correction increases the
     rain rate when the spectral ratio is small. However, even with this beamfilling
     correction, tropical rainfall is still unrealistically low when the freezing level in the
     Tropics (5 km) is used to specify the rain layer thickness. Realism is restored
     by reducing the assumed tropical rain-layer thickness to 3 km. This adjustment is
     probably compensating for two processes: 1) the existence of warm rain for
     which the rain layer does not extend to the freezing level and 2) very heavy rain
     for which the 19-GHz channels saturate. Global rain rates are produced for the
     1991ï¾–94 period from two SSM/Is. The authors find that approximately 6% of the
     SSM/I observations detect measurable rain rates (R &gt; 0.2 mm h1). The global
     rain maps show features that are, in general, similar to those reported in previously
     published rain climatologies. However, some differences that seem to be related
     to nonprecipitating cloud water are apparent.</abstract>
