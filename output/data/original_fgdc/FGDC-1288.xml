      <abstract>According to the World Wildlife Fund, the United States is the ultimate destination for most of the endangered plants and animals taken illegally around the world. As Doug Schneider reports in this weekï¾’s Arctic Science Journeys Radio, a fair number of these
endangered species are smuggled into the United States through the Ted Stevens International Airport in Anchorage, Alaska.</abstract>
      <purpose>Many of the items confiscated each year by law enforcement officers with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service were brought into the U.S. by people who just didn't know that what they had was illegal. 

Things like sealskin slippers and gloves, walrus tusks, and whale teeth are popular souvenirs, says Chris Andrews, a wildlife inspection officer with the service. Most people readily show officers what they have, but he says a few try to slip their souvenirs past inspectors.</purpose>
