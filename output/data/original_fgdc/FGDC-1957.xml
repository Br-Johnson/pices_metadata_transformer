      <abstract>All marine mammals have the remarkable ability to dive and forage for extended periods below the ocean surface. But few marine mammals dive deeper or stay longer below the surface than do elephant seals. As Doug Schneider reports in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio, one Alaska scientist is unraveling the mysteries of the elephant seal's amazing diving ability.</abstract>
      <purpose>Alaska is famous for its walrus, its seals and its Steller sea lions. But few people know that Alaska plays host to thousands of northern elephant seals, too. That's probably because elephant seals don't usually come ashore in Alaska. And they don't spend much time lounging about on the surface, either, so few people ever catch a glimpse. Rather, they spend the summer foraging the deep ocean seafloorï¾—usually from 1,000 to 2,500 feet below the surface, but sometimes as deep as 5,000 feet. Exactly how these two-tonned hulks are able to dive to depths that would crush other animals is a mystery that scientist Russ Andrews is trying to unravel.</purpose>
