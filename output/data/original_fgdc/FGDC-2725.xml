        <p>In September and October, 1975, and again in July, 1976, the distribution of dissolved low molecular weight hydrocarbons was determined in Bristol Bay, Alaska. The concentrations were relatively low compared to other  Alaskan shelf areas and show a significant seasonal signature. Local production of methane is accelerated in summer as it is for the alkenes. The concentrations of ethane and ethane are in linear relation in summer, suggesting a common source or perhaps a common organic precursor. The distribution of methane is strongly coupled to circulation and, in particular, to the location of hydrographic fronts. In contrast, the alkenes appear to be regulated more by biological activity than circulation. In composition, LMW hydrocarbons arising from a thermogenic source can be readily distinguished from their biological equivalents on the basis of the relative concentrations of ethane and ethane.  Elementary modeling of a line hydrocarbon source suggests that hydrocarbon trajectories could be traced for several hundred km, assuming a source concentration 100 times above ambient levels. Other model scenarios are also considered.</p>
