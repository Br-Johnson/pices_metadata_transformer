      <abstract>New carbonate data obtained on February-March and June-July cruises in the northeast Pacific during 1985 were utilized to describe processes affecting seasonal
variations of calcite and aragonite saturation. Large gradients in saturation state occur in the region between the Subtropical and the Subarctic Fronts in the
north-south direction. These gradients are a function of large-scale mixing and biological processes in the North Pacific. The saturation values in the upper kilometer
of the water column were observed to be significantly lower in winter than in summer. These decreases were due to a number of processes including: (i) the seasonal
decrease in the temperature of the water column; (ii) the seasonal increase in vertical mixing causing CO-enriched deep waters to be upwelled; and (iii) the seasonal
enhancement of respiration over photosynthesis. Seasonal changes in total CO (TCO) concentrations appeared to have the greatest overall effect on the saturation
state. Aragonite dissolution rate experiments were conducted during the June-July cruise to provide an independent verification of the saturation calculations. In all
cases, significant increases in aragonite dissolution were observed below the 100% saturation depth. In the northeast Pacific, shallow undersaturation horizons
provide for significant dissolution rates at depths below 400 m.</abstract>
