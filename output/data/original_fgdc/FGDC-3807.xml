        <p>The Wakatake maru (666 gross tons) departed Kushiro on June 8, 2002 and returned on July 21, 2002. There were 28 experimental fishing stations during the cruise. Nineteen fishing stations were located in the vicinity of 180º longitude from 41ºN to 58º30ﾒN latitude, and nine operations were conducted in the international waters of the central Bering Sea.</p>
        <p>Three types of externally-attached archival tags were used. One tag, used by FRI, is manufactured by Lotek Marine Technologies, Newfoundland, Canada (model LTD 1100-300; size = 8mm x 16mm x 27mm; weight in air = 5 grams; number of records = 32,768) and records temperature and depth data. Sampling interval of LTD depends on total recording time, which is referred as Time Extension Recording. The logger begins recording at a base sampling interval of 1 sample every 14.063 seconds. When its memory is full, the logger doubles its sampling interval and continues recording, overwriting every other sample in memory, and when its memory is filled at that sampling interval it doubles its sampling interval again. The process can repeat almost indefinitely. Another tag used by FRI is a Thermonchron iButton data storage device, manufactured by Dallas Semiconductor, Inc., and repackaged for fish tagging by AlphaMach, Inc. (model iB4; size = 8 mm x 16 mm x 24 mm; weight in air = 3.8 grams; number of records = 2048). The iB4 records temperature data only. A third type of archival tag is manufactured by the Little Leonard Ltd., Tokyo, Japan (model W190L-PDT; cylinderal shape = 110 mm in length and 20 mm in diameter; weight in air = 75 grams) and records swimming speed, depth, and temperature. The Number of records can be varied between 2,000,000 - 4,000,000, which depends on the variation of data. The speed sensor of the loggers consists of a propeller rotation counter. All types of tags were attached externally in the dorsal musculature of the fish anterior to the dorsal fin with stainless wires, or nickel pins.</p>
        <p>Steelhead trout were tagged with iB4 (sampling intervals of temperature data = 4.25 hour). In the Bering Sea, we selected large maturing chum salmon considered to be of Japanese origin, and older than 0.3 age among the disk tagged fish. We attached a PDT (sampling intervals of data: speed and depth = 2; temperature = 60 sec), or double tagged these chum salmon with both a LTD and iB4 (sampling intervals of temperature = 1.50 hour) to these fish. Other immature and mature chum salmon were tagged with iB4 tags. Sampling intervals of iB4 tags were set at 4.25 hour and 1.5 hour for immature and mature fish, respectively. Sockeye and chinook salmon were tagged with either a LTD or iB4 tag (sampling intervals = 4.25 hour).</p>
        <p>Archival tags were attached to a total of 84 salmonids with disk tags. In the central North Pacific Ocean, 4 sockeye, 3 immature chum, and 2 steelhead trout were released with LTD or iB4 tags. In the Bering Sea, 9 chum with iB4; 36 mature chum of Japanese origin with PDT, or double tagged with a LTD and iB4; and 18 chinook and 12 sockeye salmon were released carrying a LTD or iB4 archival tag.</p>
