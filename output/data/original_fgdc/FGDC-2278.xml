      <abstract>Sea ice concentration data set was derived from the dual-polarized 37-ghz channel radiances from the Nimbus-7 SMMR.  Sea ice concentrations, i.e., fraction of ice cover in a 30 x 30 km field of view, are grouped in scenes, each covering an area of 780 x 780 km.  This data set was derived from the cell-all tapes (NSSDC id 78-098a-08b), and there are six days of data per one or two tapes.  These tapes are available from NSSDC A similar data set (map-30) containing six-day and monthly averages of 37-ghz horizontal polarization channel brightness temperatures projected on to 533 x 533 mercator map grids is also available from NSSDC.  The map-30 data set was also generated from the cell-all tapes.  No map-30 data were produced beyond year 5 (October 1983).</abstract>
