      <abstract>Analyses of data from three shipborne surveys describe the quasi-synoptic
     density and velocity fields near Barrow Canyon, Alaska. The canyon parallels the
     northwestern coast of Alaska and contains three different water masses. These
     are 1) warm and fresh Alaskan coastal waters that originate from the Bering
     Strait; 2) cold and moderately salty waters that originate from the Chukchi shelf;
     and 3) warm and salty waters that originate from the Atlantic layer of the Arctic
     Ocean. A halocline separates the Chukchi shelf and Atlantic layer waters. The
     halocline slopes upward into the canyon where it is then twisted to slope across
     the wide canyon. An intensification of the Beaufort gyre near the shelf break just
     seaward of Barrow Canyon raises the halocline more than 100 m toward the
     surface. Locally upwelling favorable winds raise the Arctic halocline, which thus is
     ventilated within Barrow Canyon adjacent to the coast. In the absence of winds
     the halocline slopes across-canyon in the thermal wind sense due to a northward
     flowing coastal current.

       Velocity measurements from a towed acoustic Doppler current profiler reveal a
     northward flowing jet that transports about 0.3 Sv (Sv  106 kg m3) of Bering
     Sea summer water into the Arctic Ocean at speeds that exceed 0.7 m s1. Total
     northward transports through the canyon exceed 1.0 Sv. The warm waters of this
     coastal current supply more than 100 W m2 of heat to the atmosphere. The jet
     separates both from the bottom and from the coast. Hence, a laterally and
     vertically sheared jet forms, which breaks into three branches at about 71.8°N
     latitude.</abstract>

    <descript>
      <abstract>The highest concentration and greatest seasonal amplitudes of atmospheric
     CO2 and CH4 occur at 60°-70°N, outside the 30°ﾖ60°N band where the main
     sources of anthropogenic CO2 and CH4 are located, indicating that the northern
     environment is a source of these gases. Based on the author's onshore and
     offshore arctic experimental results and literature data, an attempt was made to
     identify the main northern sources and sinks for atmospheric CH4 and CO2. The
     CH4 efflux from limbic environments in the north plays a significant role in the CH4
     regional budget, whereas the role of the adjacent arctic adjacent seas in regional
     CH4 emission is small. This agrees with the aircraft data, which show a
     10%-15% increase of CH4 over land when aircraft fly southward from the Arctic
     Basin. Offshore permafrost might add some CH4 into the atmosphere, although
     the preliminary data are not sufficient to estimate the effect. Evolution of the
     northern lakes might be considered as an important component of the climatic
     system. All-season data obtained in the delta system of the Lena River and typical
     northern lakes show that the freshwaters are supersaturated by CO2 with a
     drastic increase in the CO2 value during wintertime. The arctic and Antarctic CO2
     data presented here may be used to develop understanding of the processes
     controlling CO2 flux in the polar seas. It is shown that Arctic seas are a sink for
     atmospheric CO2, though supersaturation by CO2 is obtained in areas influenced
     by riverine output and in coastal sites. The pCO2 difference between the surface
     of the Southern Ocean and atmosphere observed in the austral autumn shows that
     the area east of 7°W might be considered a source of CO2 into the atmosphere,
     whereas the area west of 7°W is a net sink of CO2. This is corroborated with
     literature data that indicate an overestimate of the role of Antarctic waters as a sink
     for atmospheric CO2.</abstract>
