        <p>This project examined the abundance, taxa stage and size of copepod nauplii available as prey for walleye pollock larvae in their deep water spawning grounds of the southeastern Bering Sea.  Nauplii of the genera Oithona, Eucalanus and Metridia were the most commonly encountered types while Pseudocalanus and Microcalanus were rare.  There was most interannual variation in the taxa and abundance of copepod nauplii coexisting with the pollock larvae.  Stages I- IV of Oithona were present at 0 to 8 1-1 at different depths.  Individual stages III-VI of Metridia nauplii occurred at 0 to 6 1-1, while Eucalanus nauplii were present at 0.1 to 9 1-1, depending on stage and depth.  Nauplii III - IV of the genera Pseudocalanus and III -VI Microcalanus were usually present at less than 1 1-1.</p>
