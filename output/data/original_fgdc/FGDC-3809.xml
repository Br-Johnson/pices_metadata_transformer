        <p>The survey consisted of two cruise legs between September 5 and October 8 with a port call in Dutch Harbor. The first leg involved sampling 23 rope trawl stations along the Aleutian chain in the Bering Sea basin or within the proximity of the Aleutian Islands, resulting in the capture of 27,548 fish and squid (biomass of 2,868 kg) and included at least 17 species. The second leg involved sampling 21 rope trawl stations on or adjacent to the Eastern Bering Sea shelf, resulting in a catch of 269,127 fish and squid (biomass of 1,590 kg), and included at least 22 species. Immature chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) were present at the highest biomass levels in the catch during leg 1, followed by juvenile Atka mackerel (Pleurogrammus monopterygius). Catch of juvenile Atka mackerel was significantly higher along the western Aleutian chain (west of 180 degrees longitude) than the eastern Aleutian chain, whereas catches of immature sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) were higher along the eastern Aleutian chain. Juvenile walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) occurred at the highest biomass levels in the catch during leg 2 and were captured primarily in the middle shelf habitat of the Eastern Bering Sea shelf along with adult walleye pollock. Immature chum salmon had the second highest biomass levels and were caught primarily in the outer shelf and oceanic habitats, similar to the distribution of juvenile Atka mackerel. Juvenile chum and chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) were captured primarily in the inner shelf habitat along with herring (Clupea pallasi) and capelin (Mallotus villosus). Juvenile Pacific ocean perch (Sebastes alutus) and juvenile sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) were caught exclusively in the outer shelf habitat. Juvenile salmon captured on the Eastern Bering Sea shelf were larger than those of juvenile salmon captured in Southeast Alaska during October 1997. In 1997, Southeast Alaska juvenile salmon had the highest rate of growth observed between 1997 and 2002. This limited information provides evidence indicating that the size of Eastern Bering Sea juvenile salmon as they enter their first marine winter was not an important limiting factor in 2002. The 1999 brood year of chum salmon (age 0.2) was the predominate brood year of chum salmon captured during the survey and made up 65% (n=1000) of the immature chum salmon captured. The low percentage of age 0.1 chum salmon captured during the survey (25%) indicates that the bulk of the 2000 chum salmon brood year was distributed outside of the survey area. Preliminary results of salmon stomach contents examined during leg 1 indicated that immature chum and sockeye diets contained a high proportion of euphausiids (Thysaneossa spp.) and hyperiid amphipods (Themisto pacifica). Average sea surface temperature and salinity were lowest on the Northern Bering Sea shelf due to the influence of the Yukon River on surface waters along the Eastern Bering Sea shelf.</p>

      <purpose>
        <p>To collaborate with other BASIS programs to 1) define migratory routes and spatial overlap of significant stock groups of salmon in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands ecosystems, and 2) evaluate the nutritional status, forage availability, and growth of salmon in the Bering Sea.</p>
