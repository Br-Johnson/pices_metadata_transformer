      <abstract>Surface air temperatures from a 1000-yr integration of a coupled
     atmosphere ocean model with constant forcing are analyzed by using a method
     that decomposes temperature variations into a component associated with a
     characteristic spatial structure and a residual. The structure function obtained from
     the coupled model output is almost identical to the so-called cold oceanﾖwarm
     land (COWL) pattern based on observations, in which above-average spatial
     mean temperature is associated with anomalously cold oceans and anomalously
     warm land. This pattern features maxima over the high-latitude interiors of Eurasia
     and North America. The temperature fluctuations at the two continental centers
     exhibit almost no temporal correlation with each other. The temperature variations
     at the individual centers are related to teleconnection patterns in sea level pressure
     and 500-mb height that are similar to those identified in previous observational
     and modeling studies. As in observations, variations in the polarity and amplitude
     of this structure function are an important source of spatially averaged surface air
     temperature variability.

       Results from parallel integrations of models with more simplified treatments of
     the ocean confirm that the contrast in thermal inertia between land and ocean is
     the primary factor for the existence of the COWL pattern, whereas dynamical
     airﾖsea interactions do not play a significant role. The internally generated
     variability in structure function amplitude in the coupled model integration is used
     to assess the importance of the upward trend in the amplitude of the observed
     structure function over the last 25 yr. This trend, which has contributed to the
     accelerated warming of Northern Hemisphere temperature over recent decades,
     is unusually large compared with the trends generated internally by the coupled
     model. If the coupled model adequately estimates the internal variability of the real
     climate system, this would imply that the recent upturn in the observed structure
     function may not be purely a manifestation of unforced variability. A similar
     monotonic trend occurs when the same methodology is applied to a model
     integration with time-varying radioactive forcing based on past and future CO2 and
     sulfate aerosol increases. This finding illustrates that this decomposition
     methodology yields ambiguous results when two distinct spatial patterns, the
     ﾓnaturalﾔ COWL pattern (i.e., that associated with internally generated variability)
     and the anthropogenic fingerprint, are present in the simulated climate record.</abstract>
