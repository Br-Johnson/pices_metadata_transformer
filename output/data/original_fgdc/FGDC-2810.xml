      <abstract>Elevated levels of cadmium in Pacific walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens) and northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) have been reported in populations from the Bering Sea. Russian and US authorities are concerned because of the possible health hazards from consuming pinniped meat harvested for subsistence peoples. The effects of cadmium on marine mammals have not been determined, but high concentrations of this element in humans and laboratory animals have been correlated with renal, skeletal, and biochemical dysfunctions. During April-May 1991, animals from four main areas along the ice front in the Bering Sea were shot humanely. Of 509 stomachs examined, fresh prey specimens were available only in 15 walrus taken near Cape Navarin (Russia) and three near Nunivak Island (Alaska). Only readily identifiable, relatively undigested specimens of the most common prey types were retained.</abstract>
