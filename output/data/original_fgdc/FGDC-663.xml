      <abstract>Data Type: Exxon Valdez Oil Spill;  Database used to track and record EVOS samples taken for chemical analysis. Data contains where sample was collected and what analysis was performed. Lab tests were performed on water, tidal sediments, subtidal sediments, and some tissue samples. While most of the data comes from water quality in Prince William Sound early in the spill, there are limited test results for fate and effects from environmental impacts from Seward, Homer or Kodiak areas. This database could be linked to the ADEC's GIS system.</abstract>
