      <abstract>The characteristics of extratropical low-frequency variability are examined
     using a comprehensive atmospheric general circulation model. A large
     experiment consisting of 13 45-yr-long integrations forced by prescribed sea
     surface temperature (SST) variations is analyzed. The predictability of
     timescales of seasonal to decadal averages is evaluated. The variability of a
     climate mean contains not only climate signal arising from external boundary
     forcing but also climate noise due to the internal dynamics of the climate
     system, resulting in various levels of predictability that are dependent on the
     forcing boundary conditions and averaging timescales. The focus of this study
     deviates from the classic predictability study of Lorenz, which is essentially
     initial condition sensitive. This study can be considered to be a model
     counterpart of Maddenﾒs ﾓpotentialﾔ predictability study.

       The tropical SST anomalies impact more on the predictability over the
     Pacific/North America sector than the Atlantic/Eurasia sector. In the former
     sector, more significant and positive impacts are found during El Ni￱o and La
     Ni￱a phases of the ENSO cycle than during the ENSO inactive period of
     time. Furthermore, the predictability is significantly higher during El Ni￱o than
     La Ni￱a phases of the ENSO cycle. The predictability of seasonal means
     exhibits large seasonality for both warm and cold phases of the ENSO cycle.
     During the warm phases, a high level of predictability is observed from
     December to April. During the cool phases, the predictability rapidly drops to
     below normal from November to March. The spring barrier in the
     atmospheric predictability is therefore a distinct phenomenon for the cold
     phase, not the warm phase, of the ENSO cycle. The cause of the barrier can
     be traced to the smaller climate signal and larger climate noise generated
     during cold events, which in turn can be traced back to the rapidly weakening
     negative SST anomalies in the tropical Pacific east of the date line.

       Due to the fact that the signal to noise ratio of this model climate system is
     very small, an upper bound in atmospheric predictability is present, even
     when a perfect model atmosphere is considered and large ensemble mean
     predictions are exploited. The outstanding issues of the dynamical short-term
     climate prediction employing an atmospheric general circulation model are
     examined, the current model deficiencies identified, and continuing efforts in
     model development addressed.</abstract>
