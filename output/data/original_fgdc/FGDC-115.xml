      <abstract>Total harvest, bycatch, catch utilization, and discards are currently
                        the subjects of considerable attention and debate worldwide. This
                        report documents reported catch, bycatch, utilization, and discard
                        data and attempts to identify patterns and trends in the commercial
                        Groundfish fisheries of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA), eastern Bering
                        Sea, and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) (areas which currently make up
                        the United States' Exclusive Economic Zone off Alaska). The
                        report identifies existing data sources and examines the historical
                        catch record, as well as current domestic Groundfish fisheries in
                        these areas.

                        Many factors have contributed to the increased interest in this
                        issue. Among these are: 1) improvements in understanding of basic
                        ecological relationships and fish stock dynamics; 2) changes in
                        fishing effort, capacity, and technology; 3) the increasing economic
                        and market importance of these fisheries; and 4) changes in
                        management capability and authority (e.g., extension by the United
                        States of exclusive management authority under the Magnuson
                        Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976).

                        There are many reasons why Groundfish fisheries discard
                        Groundfish. Among these are: 1) the directed fishery for a given
                        species, say species A, may be closed (due to quota or other
                        restrictions) forcing all other fisheries which catch species A as
                        bycatch to discard it; 2) individual fish in the catch are too small or
                        large for mechanical processors, or are the wrong sex (e.g., males
                        in the rock sole roe fishery); 3) to change the species composition
                        of their total catch for the reporting week, preventing the vessel
                        from being considered a "participant" in a particular fishery for that
                        week, and as such, subject to different, possibly more stringent,
                        prohibited species bycatch rate standards set by the North Pacific
                        Fishery Management Council; 4) a lack of handling or processing
                        capacity aboard the vessel; or 5) market limitations on the
                        utilization or retention of certain species. Particularly for various
                        roundfish fisheries (e.g., walleye Pollock, Pacific cod, Atka
                        mackerel and rockfish), the size composition of the target species
                        population can greatly affect the rate of discard by the fishery. If a
                        prerecruited year class is very strong, large catches of fish too
                        small for market may be unavoidable, increasing the rate of
                        discard. Discards are subtracted from catch tonnage prior to
                        calculation of product recovery rates, but discarded fish are
                        included as part of the total harvest.

                        An analysis, based upon Weekly Product Reports for 1994,
                        suggest that for all GOA and BSAI Groundfish fisheries combined,
                        approximately 15% of the total catch was discarded in-the-round.
                        Significantly, the weight of offal returned to the sea was nearly four
                        times as great as the weight of discards. About 70%, by weight, of
                        "target" catch is returned to the sea as offal; offal discharges make
                        up almost 60% of "total" catch. Thus, when considering energy
                        transfer in the ecosystem, offal production vastly overshadows
                        discard amounts.

                        Groundfish discards may have unanticipated and/or undesirable
                        economic implications. Bycatch discards may, for example,
                        impose direct economic costs on competing Groundfish fisheries in
                        the form of foregone catches. Through a series of simplifying
                        assumptions, it was possible to estimate the "opportunity cost" (as
                        measured at the first wholesale level) to target fisheries of the
                        foregone catch, attributable to Groundfish bycatch discards in
                        individual BSAI and GOA fisheries.

                        In 1994, all BSAI Groundfish fisheries discarded an aggregate total
                        of 162,161 metric tons (t) of allocated Groundfish species for
                        which the total allowable catch was binding . The opportunity cost
                        of these discards exceeded $91,848,000. The total retained catch
                        of all Groundfish species in these fisheries was just over  1,699,500
                        t and had a value which exceeded $925,229,800. Thus, the ratio
                        of the value of retained catch to discards (Retained/Discard Value
                        Ratio), weighted by fishery, across all BSAI Groundfish fisheries,
                        was 10.1. That is, for each dollar of bycatch "opportunity cost"
                        imposed, $10.10 of output was produced from retained catch.
                        Individual rates varied from a high of $ 29.2 in the Pollock target
                        fishery, to a low of $ 2.4 in the "other" Groundfish target fishery. In
                        the GOA Groundfish fisheries, equivalent discards totaled 15,685
                        t. The opportunity cost of these discards exceeded $14,661,597.
                        Total retained catch of all Groundfish species in these fisheries was
                        just over 196,588 t and had a value which exceeded
                        $235,825,000. Thus, the Retained/Discard Value Ratio, weighted
                        by fishery across all GOA Groundfish fisheries, was 16.1. That is,
                        for each dollar of bycatch "opportunity cost" imposed, $16.10 of
                        output was produced from retained catch. Individual rates varied
                        from a high of 45.4 in the sablefish target fishery, to a low of 3.4 in
                        the arrowtooth flounder target fishery.

                        Groundfish discards may also impact markets by affecting product
                        form, supply, and price which, in turn, influence international
                        seafood trade and U.S. market share.</abstract>
