        <p>Comparative analysis of spatio-temporal variability of Pacific salmonﾒs biological characteristics was performed based on data of three epipelagic trawl surveys conducted by
TINRO-Centre during summer-autumn of 2002 and 2003 in the western Bering Sea and adjacent Pacific waters. Species-, age- and season-specific spatial distribution of immature and mature Pacific salmon was described. The most significant differences in immature salmon distribution were noted between sockeye and chinook salmon. The most significant differences in distribution were noted between oldest (.3 and older) and youngest (.1) immature salmonﾒs age groups of all species investigated. Age specificity of distribution is much better expressed in chum and chinook salmon as compared to sockeye salmon. It was shown that species specificity of distribution increases with age of immature Pacific salmon.</p>
        <p>Adjacent age groups of chum and chinook salmon showed similarity in spatial distribution.
No similarity in distribution were noted for oldest (.3 and older) and youngest (.1) age groups of
immature chum and chinook salmon. Dissimilarity in distribution of different age groups of both
chum and chinook salmon resulted in dependence of catch rates from the distance to the coastline for particular age groups. Different age groups of sockeye salmon showed similarity in spatial distribution patterns. Season-specific spatial distribution of salmon resulted in greater similarity between two autumn period surveys ad compared with summer period survey. The observed differences in salmon spatial distribution patterns seem to be a result of species-specific and agespecific adaptive strategy, which is aimed at the lessening of density-dependent interactions and maximum utilization of available feeding grounds.</p>
