      <abstract>The island of St. Vincent and the other Windward Islands in the
     southeastern Caribbean were chosen as a field site for the study of weak
     mountain wakes. By the authorsﾒ definition, a ﾓweak wakeﾔ forms when the
     potential vorticity generated by a mountain is not strong enough to advect
     itself into eddies; rather, it is simply advocated downstream by the ambient
     flow. GOES-8 and Landsat sunlit images unambiguously revealed that the
     mountainous Windward Islands have remarkably long straight wakes. The
     length of St. Vincentﾒs wake exceeds 300 km although its width is only 20
     km. Near the islands, the wake structures reflect the details of the island
     topography. These wakes do not exhibit any obvious diurnal effect.

       Boat surveys in the lee of St. Vincent confirmed the existence of features
     seen in the images: the sharp wake boundary, the small valley-induced jet
     embedded in the near wake, and the absence of any reverse flow. Aircraft
     surveys gave evidence of descent over the island and showed that the wake
     air is relatively warm and dry. The length of the wake (L) agrees with the
     formula L = H/2CD (where H is the wake depth and CD is the surface drag
     coefficient), implying that the reacceleration of the wake air is caused by the
     ambient streamwise pressure gradient rather than by lateral entrainment of
     momentum or geostrophic adjustment.

       Two numerical models were used to simulate St. Vincentﾒs wake, a
     single-layer hydrostatic model and a 3D nonhydrostatic model. Both models
     indicated that air descent, acceleration, wave breaking, and weak potential
     vorticity generation occur over the island, causing a long straight wake.</abstract>
