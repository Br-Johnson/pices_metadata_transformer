        <p>The Survey was conducted from 10 July to 21 August 2002 to estimate the abundance of killer whales throughout a large portion of the range of the Steller sea lion western stock, from shore to approximately 30 nmi off shore. The survey was conducted as a regular line-transect survey for all cetaceans. When killer whales were encountered, the line-transect survey was temporarily suspended in order to collect photographs of killer whale dorsal fins and saddle patches for the identification of individual whales. When conditions permitted, a small boat was launched (22ﾒ or 19ﾒ rigid hull inflatable) to allow for closer approaches to the whales. Biopsy samples were also collected using a crossbow, and when possible, acoustic recordings were made to identify call types. All of this information will be used to identify whether the whales encountered were mammal eating killer whales (transients) or fish-eating killer whales (residents). Photographs will be compared to existing catalogues of killer whales in Alaska to confirm matches with whales seen previously. Biopsy samples are being genetically analyzed to confirm eco-type, as transients and residents are readily distinguished by their mitochondrial DNA haplotype.</p>
