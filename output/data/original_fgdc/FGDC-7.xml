      <abstract>On September 12, 1991, at the 121st annual meeting of the American
     Fisheries Society, more than 150 fisheries scientists, ecologists, and resource
     managers shared experiences and forged a link between fishery management
     and marine protected areas. Thirteen formal presentations on marine reserves
     and fishery refugia catalyzed a lengthy and far-ranging discussion of the
     potential of refugia as fishery management tools, the strengths and limitations
     of refugia-based management, existing evidence of refugia efficacy, the need
     for further testing, and design considerations for fishery refugia. The
     presentations represented a wide variety of ecological and socioeconomic
     systems, ranging from tropical coral reef in Western Australia, Florida,
     Bermuda, and the Cayman Islands, through temperate reef systems in
     California, New Zealand, and South Australia, to arctic systems in the Bering
     Sea; crustacean and molluscan fisheries were examined as well as those for
     temperate and tropical reef finfishes.</abstract>
