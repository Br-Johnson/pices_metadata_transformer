      <abstract>This paper discusses the behavior of the Arctic Ocean surface air
     temperature field for 1979ﾖ93. Temperatures are derived from a new
     gridded 6-h, 2-m air temperature dataset called POLES. These gridded air
     temperatures are estimated from optimal interpolation of temperature inputs
     from drifting buoys, manned Soviet North Pole (NP) drifting ice stations,
     coastal land weather stations, and ship reports. In processing the POLES
     data, the winter and summer properties of the mean NP temperatures are
     used to discard inaccurate or snow-covered buoys and to remove a summer
     warm bias. Comparison of the POLES and specific NP temperatures shows
     that the POLES temperature behaves well and gives better results than other
     gridded temperature datasets. Maps of the mean seasonal temperatures give
     realistic results consistent with other published estimates, and plots of the
     summer advance and retreat of the 0°C isotherm show the expected
     asymmetry between advance and retreat associated with the open water
     formation adjacent to the coasts. Also, comparison of the regional POLES
     observations of the annual onset of melt and freeze with published estimates
     derived from visible and passive microwave satellite data gives realistic
     results. However, problems with the dataset arise in the post-1991 period
     from the termination of the NP stations and a reduction in the number of
     Siberian and Alaskan weather stations. In spite of these problems, the paper
     shows that the POLES dataset provides an improved air temperature field
     for use in numerical sea ice models and for comparison with satellite
     datasets.</abstract>
