      <abstract>For years, scientists and fishermen have puzzled over the mysterious declines of salmon along the Yukon Riverﾗthe vast waterway that stretches 1,500 miles from the Bering Sea through Alaska to headwaters in Canada. Now, thanks to a perceptive fisherman, scientists are one step closer to understanding the riverﾒs salmon crash. Doug Schneider has more in this weekﾒs Arctic Science Journeys Radio.</abstract>
      <purpose>Bill Fliris has lived in the remote village of Tanana, on the banks of Alaska's Yukon River, for the past 25 years. Each summer, he catches king salmon weighing 30 pounds or more. The fish feed himself and his family.  But over the years, he's watched firsthand as fewer and fewer salmon returned from the sea to spawn. Scientists can't explain the declines, and clues are hard to come by.  Now, it turns out that a salmon Fliris caught one day in 1986 may hold at least some of the answers.</purpose>
