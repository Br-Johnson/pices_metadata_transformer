      <abstract>Rotated principal component (RPC) analysis, subject to the varimax
     criterion and including area weighting, is applied to a 58-yr record (1931ï¾–88)
     of monthly- and seasonal-mean Climatic Division precipitation anomalies for
     the contiguous United States to document wintertime precipitation variability
     in the region of California. Rotated principal components (time series) derived
     from this analysis are related to anomalies of seasonal-mean global sea
     surface temperature, and monthly mean Northern Hemisphere 500-hPa
     geopotential height and sea level pressure (SLP).

       Wintertime seasonal-mean precipitation in California is captured by two
     RPCs. The first RPC documents coherent precipitation anomalies centered in
     northern California, Oregon, southern Idaho, and eastern Washington, and
     explains the largest portion of area-averaged variance of any of the patterns in
     the decomposition. A second RPC captures coherent precipitation variability
     in the south coast and southeast desert regions of California, southern
     Nevada, southern Utah, and northern Arizona. Fluctuations in the first RPC
     correlate poorly with Pacific Ocean SST anomalies. However, wet winters in
     the region of the second RPC correlate modestly with simultaneous cool
     western subtropical Pacific Ocean SST anomalies and weakly with warm
     SST anomalies over a broad region of the central and eastern tropical Pacific.
     The spatial scale of the tropical SST correlation and the prominent
     multidecadal timescale signal of the RPC are consistent with ENSO
     fluctuations on this timescale influencing southern California precipitation.

       Consistent with the results of earlier studies, significant correlation are
     found between California wintertime monthly mean precipitation variability
     and regional 500-hPa geopotential height and SLP anomalies. Linear
     regression analysis is used to construct estimates of the total 500-hPa
     geopotential height and SLP fields (Climatology plus anomaly) that are
     representative of the extreme wet and dry California winter months; these are
     then compared with the observed conditions in the individual extreme months.
     Several different flow patterns appear capable of producing anomalously
     large monthly precipitation totals in California.</abstract>
