      <abstract>Data of R/V Professor Soldatov cruise 4 (October to November 1990) are used to demonstrate the synoptic scale thermohaline structure of shelf fronts in the western Bering Sea and to derive their characteristics. In the western Bering Sea, as in the eastern Bering Sea shelf, there is a multi frontal pattern. However, here, its structure has several characteristics: the inner front sometimes is manifested only in the near-bottom layer, while the middle front often joins the outer front to form a single frontal zone, etc. These features are caused by the different nature of the western Bering Sea shelf which is much narrower than the eastern one. Therefore the western shelf is strongly affected by the Kamchatka current, and is being periodically influenced by the Anadyr current. Additionally, the western shelf's relief is less uniform and more complex. The actual structure of the frontal system thus is formed as a result of interaction
between synoptic shelf eddies and slope eddies.</abstract>
