      <abstract>A coupled iceﾖmixed layerﾖocean model is constructed for the Arctic
     Ocean, the Barents Sea, and the GreenlandﾖIcelandﾖNorwegian Sea. The
     model is used to address Arctic numerical modeling with and without climate
     restoring. The model without climate restoring reproduces basic observed
     features of the Arctic iceﾖocean circulation. The simulated oceanic
     processes adjust to the surface and lateral fluxes and transport heat and
     mass in a way that achieves a rough salt and heat balance in the Arctic in the
     integration period of seven decades. The main deficiency of the model is its
     prediction of unrealistically high salinity in the central Arctic, which tends to
     weaken the ocean currents.

       The introduction of corrective salinity and temperature restoring terms has
     a significant impact on prediction of the iceﾖocean circulation in the Arctic.
     The impact results from a chain reaction. First, the restoring terms change
     the salinity and thermal states in the oceanic mixed layer and below. The
     altered density structure, in turn, influences the ocean circulation by altering
     the oceanﾒs dynamic and thermodynamic processes. The ocean circulation
     then affects ice motion and ice thickness by altering the dynamics and
     thermodynamics of the ice. Restoring only ocean salinity induces a heat
     surplus or deficit, which causes the oceanic thermal state to drift away from
     the Climatology. This is also the case with restoring both salinity and
     temperature in the upper ocean. Only restoring salinity and temperature in
     the deeper ocean is likely to avoid climate drift in the Arctic.

       This paper points out the problems of using models without climate
     restoring and the consequences of using models with climate restoring for
     Arctic iceﾖocean modeling. It stresses the need to use a realistic
     representation of surface fluxes in order to improve prognostic simulations. It
     also stresses the importance of oceanic processes such as connective
     overturning and vertical advection both in the Arctic and in the adjacent
     oceans. If these processes are not reasonably represented, the models can
     predict over warm intermediate layers in the Arctic and an excessive heat
     influx at Fram Strait, causing the Arctic ice pack to possibly shrink gradually,
     a scenario global climate models should avoid.</abstract>
