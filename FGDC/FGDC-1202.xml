      <abstract>As part of the U.S. JGOFS Equatorial Pacific Process Study, measurements of CO species concentrations were made in the atmosphere and in the surface waters
of the central and eastern equatorial Pacific during the boreal spring and autumn of 1992. Surface water fCO data indicate significant differences between the
springtime El Ni￱o conditions and the autumn post-El Ni￱o conditions. The autumn fugacity (fCO) maxima were approximately 15-55 µatm higher than in the
spring. The lower surface fCO values in the spring data set were the result of: (i) advection of CO-depleted water from the west at the equator near 170°W; and
(ii) reduced upwelling and lower fCO distributions as consequence of lighter zonal winds in the eastern Pacific from 140°W to 110°W. Assuming the springtime
data are representative of the El Ni￱o conditions and the autumn data are representative of the post-El Ni￱o conditions, it is estimated that the net annual CO flux
during the 1991-92 ENSO period to be 0.3 Gt C. Over 60% of this flux occurred during the 4-month period in the autumn when fCO2 values were close to
normal. The net annual reduction of the ocean-atmosphere CO flux during the 1991-92 El Ni￱o is estimated to be on the order of 0.5-0.7 Gt C.</abstract>
