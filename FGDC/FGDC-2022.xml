      <abstract>This journal article references oil contaminant data of invertebrate species (Mytilus  trossulus) from Prince William Sound, Alaska.

  The aforementioned data are referenced in citation: Babcock, M. M., P. M. Harris, and S. D. Rice. 1997. Restoration of oiled mussel beds in Prince William Sound, Alaska, five years after the Exxon Valdez oil spill. Journal of Shellfish Research 16(1): 258.

  This literature was collected as part of a metadatabase that represents one or more nearshore resources (from physical attributes such as water and air, to birds and mammals).  Each entry is viewable in three formats, 1) a geospatial explicit format (ArcView 3.3) named GIS ArcView 3.3 Near GEM project, 2) a spreadsheet format (Excel 2002 and within ArcView) named GEM Nearshore Metadata Set, and 3) a ProCite database named GEM Nearshore Metadata References, which consists of references included in 1 and 2 above.  The ProCite database record number corresponds to the Excel Procite Number.  Reference Procite #60 for this literature's metadata.

  The metadata are maintained in digital format (ArcView 3.3, Excel 2002, and Procite) and are available from the Alaska Science Center, USGS in Anchorage, Alaska.

  For a detailed description of the three databases and the project, see "Bodkin, J. L., and T. Dean.  2003.  Alternative Sampling Designs for Nearshore Monitoring (Gulf Ecosystem Monitoring and Research Project G-030687), US Geological Survey, Alaska Science Center, Anchorage, Alaska." available on-line at http://www.evostc.state.ak.us/pdf/GEM_final_reports/030687.pdf.</abstract>
      <purpose>Part of the design effort of the "Alternative Sampling Designs for Nearshore Monitoring" (Gulf Ecosystem Monitoring and Research Project).  Provides a comprehensive historical perspective of locations and types of past studies conducted in the nearshore marine communities within Gulf of Alaska in the form of a geographical information system database.</purpose>
