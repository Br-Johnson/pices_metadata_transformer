        <p>Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Satellites (DMSP) F8 Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) monthly averaged sea ice concentration for the polar regions for July 1987 through December 1991. Data were produced by NSIDC using the daily sea ice concentration grids that were generated using the NASATEAM algorithm (Cavalieri, et al. 1986, JGR 91(C1), p. 975-994) and distributed on CD-ROM by NSIDC.  The monthly sea ice grids are available on request via ftp (see access instructions below), and may eventually be distributed on CD-ROM with other SSM/I products.  The monthly sea ice grids can be used as a mask to block out ice-covered areas for various applications.  To accommodate as many  potential applications as possible, the monthly averaged ice extent was delineated using four concentration values (0%, 5%, 10%, and 15%) for the minimum concentrations included in the averages.  The grids are 8-bit raster images containing 448 lines of 304 pixels (304x by 448y) for the northern hemisphere and 332 lines of 316 pixels (316x by 332y) for the southern.  IDL procedures were used to calculate monthly averages from the daily-averaged SSM/I grids.  The data were then put into Hierarchical Data Format (HDF).  Utilities to read and manipulate HDF data are available via ftp from the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA).  The NCSA ftp server address is ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu; help is available from helphdf@ncsa.uiuc.edu.</p>
