          An eastern Bering Sea research cruise was conducted by National Marine Fisheries Service scientists from the Auke Bay Laboratory, Ocean Carrying Capacity program during August - October 2002 to study early marine distribution, migration, and growth of juvenile salmon (
          <em>Oncorhynchus</em>
          spp) salmon on the eastern Bering Sea shelf. A total of 10,629 salmon were captured including juvenile pink (
          <em>O. gorbuscha</em>
          ; 5.9%), chum (
          <em>O. keta</em>
          ; 43.4%), sockeye (
          <em>O. nerka</em>
          ; 42.6%), coho (
          <em>O. kisutch</em>
          ; 3.8%), and chinook (
          <em>O. tshawytscha</em>
          ; 3.0%) salmon; less than 2% of the catch consisted of immature and mature chum, sockeye, and chinook salmon. Juvenile pink salmon were mainly distributed offshore between 60°N to 63°N. Juvenile chum salmon were widely distributed north of 58°N, with the largest catches occurring along the 168°W transect and between 60°N to 63°N east of 169°W. Juvenile sockeye salmon were distributed south of 59°N, with the largest catches occurring north of 57°N along the 165°W transect. Juvenile coho and chinook salmon were distributed nearshore along transects north of 58°N. Juvenile pink, chum, sockeye, and chinook salmon were smallest within the area sampled during Leg 1 (southeastern Bering Sea; Bristol Bay) and largest within the area sampled during Leg 2 (northeastern Bering Sea). Juvenile sockeye salmon aged by the Alaska Department of Fish and Gameﾒs Mark, Tag, and Age Laboratory in Juneau, Alaska indicated that 69% were age 1.0 and 31% were age 2.0. Analyses of plankton, stomach contents, age, size, and growth data, and genetic stock identification, will be done for additional information on the growth and migration characteristics of juvenile salmon on the eastern Bering Sea shelf.
