        <p>Traumatization and infestation of the Pacific salmon in the western Bering Sea and adjacent Pacific waters during summer-autumn period of 2003 are analysed based on data from two complex epipelagic surveys. The rates of different types of traumatization and infestation occurrence are species- and age-specific and are subject to significant spatio-temporal variability. The highest rate of sea lice infestation was observed in juvenile chinook, pink and coho salmon. Rate of North Pacific daggertooth injuries was significantly lower than rate of sea lice infestation. On the other hand, rate of North Pacific daggertooth (Anotopterus nikparini) injuries was significantly higher than rate of lampreys (most likely by Pacific lamprey (Lampetra tridentata)) and longnose lancetfish (Alepisaurus ferox) injuries. The highest rate of North Pacific daggertooth injuries was observed in immature and mature chum salmon. Rate of lamprey injuries was extremely low in all salmon species. The highest rates of lamprey injuries were observed in mature pink, coho and chum salmon. The spatial distribution of traumatized and infected salmon was non-uniform and aggregated in its character. Average length of juvenile, immature and mature salmon specimens infected with sea lice was higher compared to healthy fish. Clark condition factor seemed not to be influenced by sea lice infestation. Average length of immature chum and sockeye salmon with North Pacific daggertooth injuries was significantly higher as compared with not traumatized fish. In addition, a significant decrease in Clark condition factor was noted for chum and sockeye salmon, which were injured by North Pacific daggertooth.</p>
