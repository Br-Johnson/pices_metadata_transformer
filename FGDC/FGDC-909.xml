      <abstract>The Naval Postgraduate School 18-km coupled Arctic Ocean and sea ice model
employs the Parallel Ocean Program (POP) adapted to the Pan-Arctic region and coupled to a parallel version of the Hibler dynamic-thermodynamic sea ice model with viscous-plastic rheology and a zero-layer thermodynamics approximation. The model grid is configured on a rotated spherical coordinate system and its resolution is 1/6° (~18 km) with 30 levels. The model domain extends from Bering Strait through the Central Arctic, Nordic and Barents Seas into the sub-polar North Atlantic (to ~45°N) and it includes the Canadian Archipelago. Daily-averaged operational atmospheric fields from the European Centre for Medium-range Weather (ECMWF) for 1994-98 are used to force the model in addition to the 1979-93 reanalyzed data. It is important to note that the only interannual forcing in the model comes from the prescribed atmospheric fields. The model has been integrated initially for 200 years forced with 1990-94 atmospheric fields. It was then spun up for 20 years using the repeated 1979 annual cycle, which was followed by an additional 2-decade integration using 1979-1998 atmospheric data.
The new 9-km coupled ice-ocean model, developed at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) in Monterey, California, USA, is configured on a 1/12° and 45-level rotated spherical grid.  It consists of a regional adaptation of the POP, developed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, coupled to a parallel version of the original Hibler dynamic-thermodynamic model with a viscous-plastic rheology.  The model uses ECMWF daily-averaged reanalyzed data for 1979-1993 and 1994-2002 operational products, including the surface incoming long wave and shortwave radiation, 2-m air temperature and dew point temperature, and 10-m winds.  The model incorporates a 2.5-km bathymetry field, developed by the International Bathymetry Charting of the Arctic Ocean project, interpolated to the 9-km grid.  The model domain extends from the
Pacific Ocean (~30°N) through the Central Arctic, Nordic and Barents Seas into the North Atlantic (to ~40°N) and it allows realistic exchanges through Bering Strait.  Results from the ongoing model integration are just becoming available.</abstract>
      <purpose>To advance the knowledge of Arctic Ocean dynamics and variability.  The model
provides large scale and long term data, while maintaining high resolution for better analysis.</purpose>
