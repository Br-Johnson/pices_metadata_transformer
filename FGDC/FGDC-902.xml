      <abstract>Survey depths ranged from about 100 m to 750 m.   The area mapped is characterized as a formerly glaciated area of  irregular seabed with mixed sediments (mostly sand, mud, and gravel) and high-relief areas consisting mostly of boulders.  Combined with submersible observations and fishing effort data, the mapping will allow habitat and geological characterization of the areas in relation to fishing intensity.  This  mapping effort is complementary to similar mapping that was done last year in the vicinity of Cape Ommaney in Southeast Alaska and on Portlock Bank northeast of Kodiak.</abstract>
      <purpose>The objective of our study is to map limited areas of the Alaska EEZ for geologic characterization using state-of-the-art technology.  During July 2002 approximately 500 km2 of  seafloor in the vicinity of the commercial fishing grounds of Pamplona Spur near Yakutat were mapped using a high-resolution multibeam echosounder that included coregistered backscatter data.</purpose>
