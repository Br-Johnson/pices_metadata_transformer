      <abstract>A global analysis of in situ observations of sea surface temperature (SST)
     developed for use at the Canadian Meteorological Center is described. The
     analysis is done on the anomaly, the departure from Climatology. The anomaly
     plus Climatology, or resulting SST, is used as the lower boundary condition by
     the numerical weather prediction model. Since there is no ocean model to
     provide a background or first-guess field for the analysis, and since anomalies
     are observed to persist over long periods, the background field is obtained
     essentially by assuming persistence of the previous anomaly. The analysis
     algorithm is statistical interpolation. Attention is focused on techniques to
     control the quality of the observations, including a technique to remove
     systematic errors from ship observations. The analysis resolution is 0.9Â° and
     the correlation e-folding distance is 212 km. Verification of the analysis is
     presented using independent data from buoys and expendable
     bathy-thermographs for a one-year period. Verification is also presented for
     the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP, Washington)
     weekly analysis and for Climatology. Results indicate that the analysis has skill
     over Climatology in all regions and skill over the NCEP weekly analysis in the
     North Atlantic. In the rest of the Northern Hemisphere, analysis error
     estimates for the two analyses are similar, while in the Southern Hemisphere
     the NCEP analysis is superior, probably due to its use of satellite data. It is
     intended that this analysis will be an essential component of a debiasing
     algorithm for satellite SST observations.</abstract>
