      <abstract>To make up this database, the Northern Fur Seal Slaughter Cards were used. These cards were  filled during the research sealings conducted at all Western Pacific seas as well as in open part of the North Pacific Ocean, at the Hokkaido and Honshu islands coast. Every fur seal being taken aboard was given a serial number. Furthermore the information on the catch date, time, geographical position in Mercator coordinate system (degrees and minutes), number of animals in group where the given specimen was taken from, and water temperature (in degrees centigrade) were also registered. Each caught seal was attentively examined for presence of a tag (a metal plate with one or two Russian or Latin letters and a number of Arabic figures imprinted). Then length (cm) and weight (kg) were measured. After flaying the animal was dissected. In case of female, its physiological condition (nulliparous, primaparous or multiparous) was determined judging by its genital organs condition, and if there was a foetus, its position was also written in (left or right uterine horn). Then the sex (male or female), weight (g) and length (cm) of the foetus taken out of the uterus were fixed.</abstract>
