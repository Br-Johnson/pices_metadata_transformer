      <abstract>Data Type: Cultural Resources;   The Alaska Heritage Resource Survey (AHRS) is an inventory of all reported historic and prehistoric sites within the State of Alaska and is maintained by the office of History and Archeology. This inventory of cultural resources includes objects, structures, buildings, sites, districts, and travel ways with a general provision that they be over 50 years old. To date nearly 15,000 sites have been recorded within Alaska (however, this is probably only a small percentage of the sites which may actually exist but are as yet unreported.) The fundamental use of the AHRS is to protect cultural resource sites from unwanted destruction. Various state, federal and private entities use the inventory for planning and reviewing development projects. The AHRS is primarily a map based system.</abstract>
