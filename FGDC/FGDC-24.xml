      <abstract>The summer-to-summer variability of the areal extent of marine stratiform
     cloudiness (MSC; stratus, stratocumulus, and fog) over the North Pacific is
     examined for the period of record 1952ﾖ92 using a dataset based on surface
     observations. Variability is largest in two regions: the central and western Pacific
     along 35°N coincident with a strong meridional gradient in climatological MSC
     amount, and the eastern Pacific near 15°N downstream of the persistent
     stratocumulus deck off Baja California. The MSC amount in both regions tends to
     be negatively correlated with local sea surface temperature (SST), suggestive of a
     positive cloud feedback on SST. The MSC amounts in the two regions also tend
     to be negatively correlated by virtue of their relationship to the basin-wide sea
     level pressure (SLP) field: a strengthening of the seasonal mean subtropical
     anticyclone is accompanied by increased cloudiness in the trade wind regime and
     decreased cloudiness in the southerly flow farther toward the west. These
     relationships are reflected in the leading modes derived from empirical orthogonal
     function analysis and singular value decomposition analysis of the MSC, SST, and
     SLP fields.

       From the 1950s to the 1980s, summertime MSC amounts increased in the
     central and western Pacific and decreased in the trade wind region, while SST
     exhibited the opposite tendencies. Although these trends contributed to the
     relationships described above, similar patterns are obtained when the analysis is
     performed on 1-yr difference fields (e.g., 1953 minus 1952, 1954 minus 1953,
     etc.). Hence, it appears that MSC plays an important role in atmosphereﾖocean
     coupling over the North Pacific during the summer season when latent and
     sensible heat fluxes are not as dominant and the coupling between atmospheric
     circulation and SST is not as strong as in winter.</abstract>
