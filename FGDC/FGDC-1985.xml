      <abstract>This book references population abundance and species composition data of invertebrate communities in western Gulf of Alaska,

  The aforementioned data are referenced in citation: AEIDC and Institute of Social, Economic and Government Research.  1974.  The Western Gulf of Alaska - A summary of available knowledge.  Prepared under contract to Marine Minerals Division, BLM, Washington.  University of Alaska, Anchorage, 599 pp.

  This literature was collected as part of a metadatabase that represents one or more nearshore resources (from physical attributes such as water and air, to birds and mammals).  Each entry is viewable in three formats, 1) a geospatial explicit format (ArcView 3.3) named GIS ArcView 3.3 Near GEM project, 2) a spreadsheet format (Excel 2002 and within ArcView) named GEM Nearshore Metadata Set, and 3) a ProCite database named GEM Nearshore Metadata References, which consists of references included in 1 and 2 above.  The ProCite database record number corresponds to the Excel Procite Number.  Reference Procite #5 for this literature's metadata.

  The metadata are maintained in digital format (ArcView 3.3, Excel 2002, and Procite) and are available from the Alaska Science Center, USGS in Anchorage, Alaska.  

  For a detailed description of the three databases and the project, see "Bodkin, J. L., and T. Dean.  2003.  Alternative Sampling Designs for Nearshore Monitoring (Gulf Ecosystem Monitoring and Research Project G-030687), US Geological Survey, Alaska Science Center, Anchorage, Alaska." available on-line at http://www.evostc.state.ak.us/pdf/GEM_final_reports/030687.pdf.</abstract>
      <purpose>Part of the GEM Nearshore Metadata References database, which is a reference collection of studies of a select assemblage of marine taxa, including alga, invertebrates, fishes, birds, and mammals that occupy nearshore habitats of the Gulf of Alaska.</purpose>
