        <p>The gross pelagic numbers and biomass of seabirds in the Subarctic Pacific Region are estimated and related to hypothetical scheme of biological productivity.</p>
        <p>Estimated standing stocks of seabirds totaled ca. 8 million in winter and 51 million in summer.  Biomass estimates equaled 4, 000 tons in winter and 29,000 tons in summer. Seabirds densities were highest in the Coastal Domain but  the greatest absolute number of birds occurred in the Central Subarctic Domain.  The Shearwaters were predominant in summer, and the Shearwaters, Laridae and Alcida shared dominance in winter.</p>
        <p>Seabirds consume an estimated 0.0 to 1.2 million tons of food per year from the Region, and void into it an estimated 120,000 to 240,000 tons of feces.  Their estimated food consumption equals the equivalent of 0.8% of the estmated primary carnivore production of the Region.  In the Central Subartic Domain, the Procellariidae are responsible for 61% of the estimated total food intake by birds.</p>
        <p>Flocking by seabirds results in the local consumption of plankton and nekton in much greater quantities than average conditions would indicate, and also has the effect of concentrating into a very small area fecal nutrients that were widely dispersed in the nekton and plankton mere hours earlier.</p>
        <p>The urgency of increasing our knowledge of the pelagic biology of seabirds is briefly discussed.</p>
        <p>This paper is based on counts of seabirds during oceanographic cruises in the Subarctic Pacific Region.  Observations during two cruises in 1969 and one in 1967, totaled 336 hours, during which the ships steamed 5,717 km.</p>

      <purpose>To summarize existing information and ideas on the pelagic biology of seabirds in the region; to estimate standing stocks and the biomass of ecological groups of these birds; to estimate their annual food ingestion and the amount of feces voided, and; to develop a quantitative working hypothesis of how seabirds fit into a simple thypothetical food chain in the Central Subarctic Domain.</purpose>
