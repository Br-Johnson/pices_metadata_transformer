        <p>Publication Title: World weather maps (pub.1965).</p>
        <p>Consist of a daily series of maps for the period July 1, 1957 through December 31, 1958.  These maps are published as monthly booklets in 3 parts, each containing a surface and 500-mb. map for 1200 GMT each day as follows:</p>
        <p>Part I covers 20°N to North Pole providing Polar sterographic projection with true scale of 1 to 50 million at latitude 60°N.  It contains sea level and 500-mb charts for the northern hemisphere from July 01, 1958 to December 31, 1958.  All observations are 1200 GMT except those for stations operated by Canada and U.S.A.  Time of these observations changes from 1230 GBT for sea-level and 1500 GMT for 500-mb., to 1200 GMT for both levels ons June 1, 1957 unless otherwise indicated.  Data tabulations of synoptic surface reports for 1200 GMT for selected stations and upper-air reports for 0000 GMT for the entire northern hemisphere.and for all observational times for the North American area also are published, under separate binding.</p>
        <p>Part II covers 25°N - 25°S providing Mercator's projection with true scale of 1 to 50 million at latitude 22 1/2° from July to December 1957.</p>
        <p>Part III covers 20°S to South Pole providing Polar sterographic projection  with true scale of 1 to 50 million along latitude 60°S from January to June 1958.</p>
