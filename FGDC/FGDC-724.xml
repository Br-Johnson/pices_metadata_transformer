      <abstract>Data Type: Multi-Resources;   Local data base was compiled in support of the Department of Natural Resources Copper River Basin Area Plan. This database was compiled through a contract to Arctic Geo Resources (AGRA) by the State of Alaska DGGS, Resource Analysis Section. The database contains data of two scales, 1:250,000 and 1:63360. Areas of high interest mapped at the 1:63360 scale, are primarily state owned lands in the central basin and along major roads. Geology and vegetation (minimum unit 20-40 acres) are the main themes mapped at the detailed scale. Other data topics, trails, roads, recreation use, political and administrative use, oil and gas resources, minerals, infrastructure, hydrology, historical and archeological sites, general geology, and geologic constraints. Other statewide coverages were used to supplement this data set. Soils were used from the area 612 Soil Survey conducted by Soil Conservation Service. Portions of this dataset have been extracted and reformatted for use in the Copper River Basin GIS Database developed by Ecotrust/Pacific GIS, in 1995.</abstract>
