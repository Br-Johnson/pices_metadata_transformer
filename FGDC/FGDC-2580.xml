        <p>Publication Title: U.S. Navy marine climatic atlas of the world.</p>
        <p>There are 9 volumes.  Vol. 1. North Atlantic Ocean -- v. 2. North Pacific Ocean -- v. 3. Indian Ocean -- v. 4. South Atlantic Ocean -- v. 5. South Pacific Ocean -- v. 6. Arctic Ocean -- v. 7. Antarctic Ocean -- v. 8. The world -- v. 9. World-wide means and standard deviations.</p>
        <p>Includes summarized monthly maps and charts of wind speed and direction; percentage frequency of surface air temperature; rain and snow; visibility; total and low cloud amounts; low ceiling and visibility; wave direction and height; wave period and height; monthly temperature extremes; mean, maximum and minimum sea surface temperatures; maximum and minimum humidity; sea level pressures; mean vector and scalar winds; low pressure centers; tropical cyclones; tides; currents; and ice.  Includes bibliographical references.</p>
        <p>Available from the NOAA Library System: URL http://www.lib.noaa.gov/.</p>
        <p>Also available from in a CDROM from NCDC.  Includes analysis and display software for climatological averages of atmospheric and oceanographic data. The data are summarized with user-defined 1 and 5 degree grid areas covering the global marine environment. The summaries are produced using predominately ship data collected between 1854-1969. The major elements include air and sea temperature, dew point temperature, scalar wind speed, sea-level pressure, wave height, wind and ocean-current roses. This CD-ROM allows the user to define element intervals (e.g. 5 to 10 knots, 2 degree temperature intervals). The CD-ROM also allows contouring for explicitly user-defined regions and exporting data to a printer or diskette. Narratives for Mediterranean ports and ocean basin climatology narratives are included in this updated version. U.S. Navy sponsored product. Requires 540K of RAM. DOS only.  The CDROM can be order from NNDC Online Store for US$130.00.  Order can be placed at http://ols.nndc.noaa.gov/plolstore/plsql/olstore.prodspecific?prodnum=C00454-CDR-A0001.</p>

      <purpose>This publication is in the National Climatic Data Center's Foreign Data Library, and is one of many books, atlases, maps, charts and other printed materials received by the NCDC from many nations over the years.  This revises the first five volumes of the series U.S. Navy Marine Climatic Atlas of the World.</purpose>
