        <p>Food habits data from Pacific salmon collected from the Bering Sea in fall 2002 were analyzed and contrasted with data collected in summer 1991-2002 for seasonal (summer-fall 2002) and long-term comparisons of salmon diets. Samples were grouped into three major habitats: (1) eastern Bering Sea shelf (&lt;200-m depth contour), (2) central Bering Sea basin (&gt;200-m depth contour), and (3) Aleutian Islands. In fall diet overlap values (modified Schoenerï¾’s index) were low to moderate for sockeye and chum salmon (49%, basin), sockeye and chinook (21%, basin), and chum and chinook (28% basin, 30% shelf). Diet overlap between sockeye and chum salmon was very high (80%) in the Aleutian Islands, where both species consumed macro-zooplankton (crustaceans and pteropods), and was reduced when chum salmon consumed gelatinous zooplankton (medusae and ctenophores). In contrast, chinook salmon consumed predominately small nekton (squid and fish). Shifts in prey composition of sockeye, chum, and chinook salmon between seasons, habitats, and salmon age groups were likely due to changes in prey availability. If prey availability is reduced by poor ocean conditions, then increased food competition could decrease growth and survival of salmon in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands.</p>
