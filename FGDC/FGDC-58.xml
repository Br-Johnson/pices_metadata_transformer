      <abstract>Eleven cold-air outbreaks from the Arctic sea ice to the open water of the
     Fram Strait and the Norwegian Sea have been monitored by aircraft during
     the field campaigns ARKTIS 1991 and ARKTIS 1993.

       Budgets of mass, water vapor, water, and heat in the atmospheric
     boundary layer are computed for boxes that are located at different distances
     from the ice edge ranging from the marginal ice zone to several hundred
     kilometers downstream.

       Averaged over all cold-air outbreaks, the large-scale flow is divergent near
     the ice edge and convergent at larger distances from the ice edge. Regardless
     of divergence, the large-scale flow exports everywhere water vapor, water,
     and heat from an atmospheric box within the boundary layer. In the case of
     the water vapor budget this export and the loss by condensation in clouds are
     compensated by evaporation from the sea surface. Both the condensation in
     clouds and surface evaporation increase in downstream direction, as does
     their ratio from about 0.4 near the ice edge to about 0.8 at distances greater
     than 300 km.

       In the water budget, the source by condensation in clouds is compensated
     by two sinks: large-scale flow export and precipitation. Precipitation
     increases absolutely from about 1ﾖ4 mm day1 in downstream direction but
     the ratio of precipitation versus condensation remains approximately constant
     at a value of 0.75.

       In contrast to the water vapor and water budgets with only one source, the
     heat budget has several sources, namely, surface heat flux, entrainment heat
     flux, condensation in clouds, and possibly radiation, which compensate for the
     heat export by the large-scale flow. The relative importance of these sources
     changes with distance from the ice edge. Near the ice edge, the surface heat
     flux at the first place and the entrainment flux at the second place are the
     relevant sources, while farther downstream in the region of deep
     convectionﾗlatent heat release by condensation is the dominating heat
     source. Here, the surface heat flux is of secondary importance and the
     entrainment flux plays a minor role.

       Since a systematic transition from roll-like to cellular-like convection
     patterns is present in Arctic cold-air outbreaks, the differences in the budgets
     with respect to distance from the ice edge apply as well to the regions of rolls
     and cells, respectively. It is hypothesized that mesoscale cellular convection
     with cloud depths of more than 1 km does not occur unless the Bowen ratio
     is less than about 0.6.</abstract>
