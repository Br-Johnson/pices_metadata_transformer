        <p>This report attempts to define the potential impact of a proposed commercial subtidal clam fishery on the ecosystem of the southern Bering Sea, particularly as regards benthic-feeding marine mammals.  To this end a brief review is presented summarizing information concerning the banthic ecosystem of the southern Bering Sea and distributions habits and dependencies of benthic-feeding marine mammals frequenting this region.  The history of comparable fisheries on the Atlantic coast is summarized, and known and potential effects of this fishery, based on the review of its past history and present methods employed, are then interpolated for the southern Bering Sea and recommendations are made as to possible management plans.</p>
        <p>Based on available information concerning the benthic ecosystem of the southern Bering Sea, the dependency of at least one marine mammal species, the Pacific walrus, on this ecosystem, and the disturbing history of the east coast clam fishery, extreme doubt is generated as to the advisability of extending such a fishery into the Bering Sea.  Consequently, the recommendation is made that such a fishery be disallowed or at least stringently controlled until further research can be completed regarding the long-term effects of such activity.</p>
