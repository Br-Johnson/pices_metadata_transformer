        <p>Publication Title: Climatic Maps of North America (pub.1936).</p>
        <p>Contains summarized surface data with monthly sea level isotherms; actual temperatures for Jan. and July; mean annual temperature range; annual maximum and minimum temperatures; mean sea level pressure Jan. and July; mean monthly and annual precipitation; average relative humidity Jan. and July; mean daytime cloudiness Jan. and July; and days with thunderstorms.</p>
        <p>Discussions of the maps are to be found in Vol. II, Part J of the Handbook, Only the legends are reproduced here.  The original size has been retained, which will permit the use of blank bases in order to extract pertinent data from a number of maps for combination onto one.  The base map is from Goodeﾒs Series of Base Maps, North America on Lambertﾒs Azinuthal Projection, No. 202.  The data on which these maps were based were compiled by the government weather services of the United States, Canada, and Mexico.</p>
