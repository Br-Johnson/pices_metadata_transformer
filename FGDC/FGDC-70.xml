      <abstract>The Climate System Model (CSM) consists of atmosphere, ocean, land,
     and sea-ice components linked by a flux coupler, which computes fluxes of
     energy and momentum between components. The sea-ice component
     consists of a thermodynamic formulation for ice, snow, and leads within the
     ice pack, and ice dynamics using the cavitating-fluid ice rheology, which
     allows for the compressive strength of ice but ignores shear viscosity.

       The results of a 300-yr climate simulation are presented, with the focus on
     sea ice and the atmospheric forcing over sea ice in the polar regions. The
     atmospheric model results are compared to analyses from the European
     Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and other observational
     sources. The sea-ice concentrations and velocities are compared to satellite
     observational data.

       The atmospheric sea level pressure (SLP) in CSM exhibits a high in the
     central Arctic displaced poleward from the observed Beaufort high. The
     Southern Hemisphere SLP over sea ice is generally 5 mb lower than
     observed. Air temperatures over sea ice in both hemispheres exhibit cold
     biases of 2ﾖ4 K. The precipitation-minus-evaporation fields in both
     hemispheres are greatly improved over those from earlier versions of the
     atmospheric GCM.

       The simulated ice-covered area is close to observations in the Southern
     Hemisphere but too large in the Northern Hemisphere. The ice concentration
     fields show that the ice cover is too extensive in the North Pacific and
     Subarctic North Atlantic Oceans. The interannual variability of the ice area is
     similar to observations in both hemispheres. The ice thickness pattern in the
     Antarctic is realistic but generally too thin away from the continent. The
     maximum thickness in the Arctic occurs against the Bering Strait, not against
     the Canadian Archipelago as observed. The ice velocities are stronger than
     observed in both hemispheres, with a consistently greater turning angle (to
     the left) in the Southern Hemisphere. They produce a northward ice
     transport in the Southern Hemisphere that is 3ﾖ4 times the satellite-derived
     value. Sensitivity tests with the sea-ice component show that both the pattern
     of wind forcing in CSM and the air-ice drag parameter used contribute to
     the biases in thickness, drift speeds, and transport. Plans for further
     development of the ice model to incorporate a viscous-plastic ice rheology
     are presented.

       In spite of the biases of the sea-ice simulation, the 300-yr climate
     simulation exhibits only a small degree of drift in the surface climate without
     the use of flux adjustment. This suggests a robust stability in the simulated
     climate in the presence of significant variability.</abstract>
