        <p>The cruise was carried out by the joint expedition of the All-Russian Research Institute of Marine Fisheries and Oceanography (VNIRO) and the Pacific Research Institute of Marine Fisheries and Oceanography (TINRO), which completely paid all the expenses in rubles (110 min. rub.) and in hard currency (U.S. $141,640) according tot the agreement with TOI DVO RAN (Pacific Oceanographic Institute of the Far East section of Russian Academy of Sciences (RAN)).  Leading scientists from Academician Vinogradov's laboratory at P. P. Shirshov Institute of Oceanology, Russian Academy of Sciences, were invited to conduct the biological investigations, since the creation of a balanced model of a functional ecosystem in the Bering Sea and the Sea of Okhotsk was the ultimate goal of this research.</p>
        <p>The investigations were conducted in five areas located in the Bering Sea and Okhotsk seas, as well as in the southern Kuril region.  Altogether, 164 multipurpose oceanographic statsions were completed.</p>
