      <abstract>Dive observations confirmed that coral was widely distributed in that region; corals and sponges were found at 30 of 31 submersible dive sites.  Disturbance to epifauna, likely from fishing activities was observed at most dive sites and appeared to be more evident in heavily fished areas.  Coral coverage on the substrate ranged from approximately 5% on low-relief pebble substrate to 100% coverage on high-relief bedrock outcrops.  Unique coral habitat consisting of high density gardens of corals, sponges, and other sessile invertebrates was found at five sites between 150 and 350 m depth.  These gardens were similar in structural complexity to tropical coral reefs and shared several important characteristics with tropical reefs, including complex vertical relief and high taxonomic diversity.</abstract>
