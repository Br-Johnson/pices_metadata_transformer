        <p>In order to investigate the environments for salmon habitat and distributions of salmon in the Bering Sea, the temperature, salinity and abundance of salmon were observed in summer to autumn in 2002. Trawl, hydrobiological, and oceanographic sampling by R/V Kaiyo maru was conducted 62 trawl operations at 38 stations from June 29 to July 14 (leg 1) and from August 21 to September 18 (leg 3 and 4) in the Bering Sea. In the Bering Sea, temperatures in the depth of 30 m were about 3 to 8 °C in leg 1, and they were about 5 to 8 °C in leg 3 and 4. A total of 11,369 salmon were captured including pink salmon (13), chum salmon (10249), sockeye salmon (738), coho salmon (4) and chinook salmon (445) in the Bering Sea. The total lipid (TL) contained in the white muscle of chum salmon caught in June and July ranged from 0.4% to 15.6% (n=123). The TL contained in chum salmon caught in September ranged from 1.0% to 21.2% (n=334). High lipid content was observed even in small size fish. Haplotypes of mitochondria DNA of chum salmon were mostly analyzed during the cruise of leg 4. The haplotypes characteristics to Asian populations were dominant in the central region of the Bering Sea.</p>
