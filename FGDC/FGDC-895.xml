      <abstract>A basinwide radio tagging study was conducted on Yukon River chinook salmon  in 2002 by the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&amp;G). Adult chinook salmon were captured in the lower river near the villages of Marshall and Russian Mission and tagged with radio transmitters.  Fish moving upriver were recorded by remote tracking stations located throughout the basin on important travel corridors and spawning tributaries.  Aerial tracking surveys were also flown to obtain detailed movement and distribution information in spawning areas.  An automated database and geographic information system (GIS) mapping program was used to summarize telemetry data in season to provide resource managers with updated information.  Work on an Internet link to the database was also completed and used during 2002.</abstract>
      <purpose>The primary objectives of the study were to provide detailed information on the movements, timing and spawning distribution of chinook salmon stocks and to help evaluate run assessment programs in the basin.</purpose>
