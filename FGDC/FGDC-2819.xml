      <abstract>Studies of Pacific herring and sand lance larvae in the Port Moller estuary of
     the southeast Bering Sea have shown that larvae are retained within the
     estuary, suggesting that retention may be important for successful year-class
     formation. To determine the mechanisms of retention, a three-dimensional
     numerical hydrodynamic model of the estuary was used to stimulate dispersal
     of fish larvae. Directed motion against the current reproduced the observed
     densities of herring larvae far better than passive drift, but passive drift of sand
     lance larvae produced roughly the same fit as directed motion. The authors
     conclude that herring and sand lance have different strategies for larval
     retention. Most herring larvae were found in the turbulent waters of upper
     Moller Bay, so directed motion may be necessary strategy to stay there. Most
     sand lance larvae are retained in the quieter waters of Herendeen Bay and
     they can move there by passive drift on tidal currents. For both species, the
     location of the eggs in relation to oceanographic features appears to be crucial
     for larval retention.</abstract>
