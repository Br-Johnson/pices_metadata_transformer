      <abstract>Recent declines in some species of marine organisms in the Bering Sea have spurred an interest in evaluating causes and predicting long-term impacts of these changes.  Red-legged kittiwakes (Rissa brevirostris) and black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) are two species of top-level predators that have declined since the mid-1970s at colonies in the Pribilof Islands, site of the largest breeding concentrations of seabirds in the southeastern Bering Sea. In contrast, Kittiwake populations have increased over
the same period at Bogoslof Island, 300 km south of the Pribilofs. Ocean climate trends
and changes in marine food webs have been listed as likely causes of changes in seabird populations, but relationships between environmental factors and seabird
population fluctuations are difficult to study directly. Nevertheless, it is important to understand causal mechanisms. We propose to compare kittiwake population parameters at the Pribilofs and Bogoslof. The Pribilof Islands lie on the continental
shelf and are surrounded by water less than 200 m deep, whereas the much deeper
water of the basin surround Bogoslof.  We plan to test the hypothesis that divergent trends in abundance of kittiwakes (Rissa spp.) at two locations in the southeastern Bering Sea are related to differences in community structure and food web production. Specifically we will evaluate whether two parameters of reproduction, productivity (e.g., chicks/pair) and chick growth rates, are higher at Bogoslof than in the Pribilofs. Furthermore, we will evaluate historic patterns of population change, timing of nesting events, and various reproduction parameters (e.g., clutch size, laying success, hatching success, fledging success, chick growth) to evaluate correlation with environmental factors. This proposal is part of a multidisciplinary project called "Regime Forcing and Ecosystem Response ReFER." It compliments and will benefit from an ongoing
seabird-monitoring program in the Pribilof Islands funded by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
