      <abstract>The halibut fishery underwent vast changes during the fifteen years from 1977
     to 1992, and a variety of new regulations were required to manage the fishery.
     The regulations published each year by the IPHC went from six pages in 1977
     to 13 pages in 1992. Important new regulations during this period included:
     (1) regulatory area changes designed to distribute the catch more evenly over
     the Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea, accommodate the separation of the
     Canadian and United States fishing fleets, and implement allocation decisions
     by the U.S. fishery management councils; (2) fishing period limits to keep the
     catch below the catch limit during short fishing seasons that resulted from more
     efficient gear and a growing fleet; (3) a ban on automated hook strippers
     (crucifiers) to lower mortality of halibut below the minimum size limit; and (4)
     numerous regulations on the sport fishery, U.S. treaty Indian fishery, some
     fisheries in the Bering Sea, and implementing allocation decisions by the U.S.
     fishery management councils. Canada went to a limited entry system in 1979
     and to an individual quota system in 1991, and a number of IPHC regulations
     that once pertained to both countries, now pertain only to the U.S. This report
     reviews changes in regulations, their rationale, and updates Skud (1977).</abstract>
