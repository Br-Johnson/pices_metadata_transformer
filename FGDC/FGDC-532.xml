      <abstract>This project will adapt a technique for assessing diets of marine mammals using fatty acid signatures to study seabirds in the southeastern Bering Sea. An NPMR project titled "Estimating seabird diets using fatty acids: Protocol development and testing of ReFER Hypotheses",  the method has numerous advantages over other more common approaches that use ratios of stable isotopes and stomach content analyses. It will test hypotheses presented in the ReFER (Regime Forcing and Ecosystem Response) conceptual model that diets of populations of nonspecific seabirds differ between oceanic and shelf habitats and that differences in diet account for opposite trends in abundance at the Pribilof Islands (shelf habitat) compared to Bogoslof Island (oceanic habitat). As part of the study, we will develop an inventory of fatty acid profiles of key forage species in the region that will be useful for diet studies of not only seabirds, but of trophically related marine mammals including sea lions, fur seals, and harbor seals. We will develop a protocol for obtaining biopsy samples of live birds, reducing their mortality rates from diet research.

      <purpose>A radio script on the  recording of the diets of seabirds (red-legged and blacked-legged kittiwakes) of the Pribilof Islands (shelf habitat) compared to Bogoslof Island (oceanic habitat).   To study forage species (e.g., pollock, lanterfish, squid, euphausiids, sand lance, capelin) and fatty acid signature in the southeastern Bering Sea, that will be of value in similar diet studies of other species of seabirds and marine mammals.</purpose>
