        <p>An integral part of Bering-Aleutian Salmon International Survey (BASIS) research is to estimate the age and stock composition of salmon migrating in the Bering Sea and adjacent waters of the North Pacific Ocean. In this document, scale pattern analysis was used to estimate the age and stock composition of immature chinook salmon caught during the R/V TINRO/BASIS survey in the western Bering Sea in fall 2002. The R/V TINRO sample was composed of three dominant age groups (41% age-1.0, 44% age-1.1, 11% age 1.2, and 4% other age groups; n=229 fish). All juvenile (age 1.0) chinook salmon were assumed to be of Asian (Kamchatka) origin. The mean accuracy of a maximum likelihood estimation model developed to identify complexes of local stocks of immature age 1.1 and 1.2 chinook salmon was about 85%. For immature age 1.1 chinook salmon (n=69 fish), the estimated stock composition was 59% East Kamchatka, 20% West Kamchatka, and 21% Western Alaska. For immature age 1.2 chinook salmon (n=22 fish), the estimated stock composition was 67% East Kamchatka, 10% West Kamchatka, and 23% Western Alaska, although none of the estimates were statistically significant (95% CIs included zero). The sample sizes were not large enough to evaluate spatial or temporal trends in chinook salmon distribution in the western Bering Sea. In conclusion, the results indicate that Asian stocks dominated catches of chinook salmon in the western Bering Sea in fall 2002, but because of insufficient sample sizes these results are considered to be preliminary.</p>
