      <abstract>Many fjords consist of deep, stratified reaches separated by shallower sills above which most of the mixing between water masses occurs.
On a long time scale, each reach can be modeled as a steady, two-layer advective flow. These flows intermingle in turbulent mixing zones,
where the flow from any incoming layer can be split into two parts: an efflux fraction, which continues on into the next reach, and a reflux
fraction, which mixes vertically and recirculates into its original reach. Using conservation of mass, we define these fractions and express
them in terms of the salinities observed in the reaches. The processes of the complex mixing zones need not be considered in detail. These
ideas are applicable to complicated branched fjords and linked sequences of reaches. Where more than two reaches meet at a multiple
junction the conservation of two tracers (usually fresh water and salt) is insufficient to determine completely the efflux/reflux fractions. We
propose an entropy maximization technique to resolve the uncertainty. Long-term pollutant concentrations relate directly to the circulation
via the new efflux/reflux formulation. The method demonstrates that refluxing leads to conservative pollutants being broadcast throughout
the fjord system with magnified concentrations. A new quantity, the mean tracer age, provides a relevant time scale that includes the
effects of recirculation and to which the rates of non-conservative processes should be compared. Conservative pollutants may be
retained for a surprisingly long time in a refluxing system.</abstract>
