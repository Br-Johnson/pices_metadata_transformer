      <abstract>Steady drift of an ice cover produces a vertically sheared current in the
     upper ocean of the Arctic. Under the ice cover, mesoscale shallow brine and
     freshening sources generate submerged anticyclones and cyclones,
     respectively. A submerged eddy extending deep into the water column
     experiences differential advections by the vertically sheared current.
     Interaction between subsurface eddies and the sheared current is examined
     using a three-dimensional numerical model in a coordinate system moving
     with the ice. The initial salinity field is in geostrophic balance with the sheared
     current, and a pulse of brine or freshening forcing produces an anticyclone or
     a cyclone. In a coordinate system moving with the ice, eddies are in a
     vertically sheared backward ambient current. To an observer looking into
     the direction of the backward ambient current, eddies move with the current
     and deflect to the right (left) for counterclockwise (clockwise) rotating
     eddies in both hemispheres. The lower half of the eddy always moves faster.
     The lateral movement can be explained by the Kuttaï¾–Zhukhovski lift
     theorem. Differential advection produces eddy tilting and entails the
     development of a narrow jet following the moving eddy. The jet reduces
     eddy straining and tilting, and eddies disperse in cases of sizeable tilts.
     Driven by a vertically sheared current, cyclones are short-lived compared
     with anticyclones because the lateral movement of a cyclone exposes the
     lower part of the eddy into waters of weaker stratification. The results help
     explain the predominance of anticyclonic eddies under the Arctic ice.</abstract>
