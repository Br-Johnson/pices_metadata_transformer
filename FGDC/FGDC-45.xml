      <abstract>A prominent year-round ensemble response to a global sea surface
     temperature (SST) anomaly field fixed to that for January 1992 (near the
     peak of a major warm El Ni￱oﾖSouthern Oscillation episode) was observed
     in a 20-yr integration of the general circulation model used for operational
     seasonal prediction by the U.S. National Weather Service. This motivated a
     detailed observational reassessment of the teleconnections between strong
     SST anomalies in the central equatorial Pacific Ocean and PacificﾖNorth
     America region 700-hPa heights and U.S. surface temperatures and
     precipitation. The approach used consisted of formation of monthly mean
     composites formed separately from cases in which the SST anomaly in a key
     area of the central equatorial Pacific Ocean was either large and positive or
     large and negative. Extensive permutation tests were conducted to test null
     hypotheses of no signal in these composites. The results provided a
     substantial case for the presence of teleconnections to either the positive- or
     negative-SST anomalies in every month of the year. These signals were
     seasonally varying (sometimes with substantial month to month changes) and,
     when present for both SST-anomaly signs in a particular month, usually were
     not similarly phased patterns of opposite polarity (i.e., the SSTﾖteleconnected
     variable relationships were most often nonlinear).

       A suite of 13 45-yr integrations of the same model described above was
     run with global SST analyses reconstructed from the observational record.
     Corresponding composites from the model were formed and compared
     visually and quantitatively with the high-confidence observational signals. The
     quantitative comparisons included skill analyses utilizing a decomposition that
     relates the squared differences between two maps to phase correspondence
     and amplitude and bias error terms and analyses of the variance about
     composite means. For the latter, in the case of the model runs it was possible
     to estimate the portions of this variance attributable to case to case variation
     in SSTs and to internal variability. Comparisons to monthly mean maps and
     analyses of variance for the 20-yr run with SSTs fixed to January 1992 values
     were also made.

       The visual and quantitative comparisons all revealed different aspects of
     prominent model systematic errors that have important implications for the
     optimum exploitation of the model for use in prediction. One of these
     implications was that the current modelﾒs ensemble responses to SST forcing
     will not be optimally useful until after nonlinear correction of
     SST-field-dependent systematic errors.  URL -- ( http://www.jodc.go.jp/service.htm )  [ A TCODE project ]</abstract>
