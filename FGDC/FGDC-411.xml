      <abstract>The stimulus for Processes and Resources of the Eastern Bering Sea Shelf (PROBES) was a mutual US - Japan scientific concern about the ability of the Bering Sea to support the huge annual catch, on a sustained basis, of groundfish, pelagic fish, crab and other marine resources.  The question was large enough to demand the attention of oceanographic disciplines from both countries as well as from others.  After several conferences, it was decided to emphasize the "Golden Triangle" (the are encompassed southeastern Bering Sea shelf in an attempt to understand the bioproductivity of this region (Hood and Kelley 1974, Hood and Takenouti 1975).  In the beginning, it appeared most expedient, for logistic and funding reasons, to have each country pursue its part of the program independently.</abstract>
