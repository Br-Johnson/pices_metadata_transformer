        <title>Transient Climate Change in the CSIRO Coupled Model with Dynamic Sea Ice</title>

      <abstract>The CSIRO coupled model has been used in a ﾓtransientﾔ greenhouse
     experiment. This model contains atmospheric, oceanic, comprehensive
     sea-ice (dynamic/thermodynamic plus leads), and biospheric submodels. The
     model control run (over 100 years long) employed flux corrections and
     displayed only a small amount of cooling, mainly at high latitudes. The
     transient experiment (1% increase in CO2 compounding per annum) gave a
     2°C warming at time of CO2 doubling. The model displayed a ﾓcold startﾔ
     effect with a (maximum) value estimated at 0.3°C. The warming in the
     transient run had an asymmetrical response as seen in other coupled models,
     with the Northern Hemisphere (NH) warming more than the Southern
     Hemisphere (SH). However, the land surface response in this model is
     different from some other transient experiments in that there is not a
     pronounced drying of the midlatitudes in the NH in summer.

       In the control run the ice model gave realistic ice distributions at both poles,
     with the NH ice in particular displaying considerable interdecadal variability.
     In the transient run the ice amount decreased more in the NH than the SH
     (corresponding with a greater NH warming). The NH ice extent and volume
     in summer was considerably reduced in depth and extent compared to the
     control. However, the model ice dynamics and thermodynamics allowed for a
     successful regrowth of the ice during the winter season to give a coverage
     comparable to that of the control run, although thinner.

       During the transient run there is a freshening of the surface salinity in the
     oceans at high latitudes. In the SH this is caused mainly by increases in
     precipitation over evaporation. The same is true for the NH, but it is found
     that there is a similar magnitude contribution to the polar freshening from ice
     melt and land runoff changes. The freshening in the North Atlantic reduces the
     strength of the meridional overturning by 35% at time of doubling of CO2.
     Other changes in the global climate at the end of the transient run relative to
     the control run are also investigated.</abstract>
