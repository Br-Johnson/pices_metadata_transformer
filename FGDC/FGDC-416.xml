      <abstract>The Bering Sea Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) held great interest for the oil companies as OCS leasing accelerated in the United States following the 1973 oil embargo.  The U.S. Department of the Interior's Minerals Management Service (MMS) has held four OCS lease sales in the Bering Sea.  More than $100 million has been spent on environmental studies to support OCS lease-sale proposals in the Bering Sea region.  Major issues and concerns associated with OCS exploration activities have been identified and migrated.  Twenty-four exploratory wells have been drilled without finding commercial quantities of oil or gas.  Except for the North Aleutian basin, where there have been no exploration drilling, there is limited interest in future near-term leasing and exploration opportunities in the Bering Sea OCS.  The MMS environmental studies effort has been significantly reduced in the Bering Sea, with the exception of completion of certain studies and monitoring of protected species as part of other ongoing studies.</abstract>
