        <p>Field work for the third year of a fishery interaction experiment was completed between 14  August and 5 September off the east side of Kodiak Island in the Gulf of Alaska as a collaborative effort between AFSC scientists.</p>
        <p>The principal objective of the experiment was to use standard acoustic survey methods to describe the spatio-temporal variability in pollock abundance and distribution patterns in two troughs over a period of several weeks before and during the commercial pollock fishery.  The study area consisted of a treatment site, Barnabas Trough where commercial fishing was allowed, and a control site, Chiniak Trough where commercial fishing was prohibited.  Repeated survey passes (Fig. 1) were conducted within each trough before and during the fishery to document whether a fishery-induced perturbation occurred in the fish distribution.  Oceanographic data to characterize the physical environment were also collected with seven current meter moorings, drifters, conductivity-temperature-depth profilers (CTDs), expendable bathythermographs (XBTs), a vessel-mounted thermosalinograph, and acoustic Doppler current profiler.</p>
