      <abstract>Salmonid (Oncorhynchus spp.) bycatch data from the 1989 U.S.,
                        Canada, and Japan monitoring program for Japanese squid driftnet
                        vessels were analyzed. Sampling effort was consistently less than
                        expected by proportionate sampling between 170°E and 180°
                        long., especially during the first part of the month when capture of
                        salmonids would most likely occur. Salmonid incidence (the
                        proportion of monitored operations encountering salmonids) was
                        highest at the western and eastern boundaries of the fishery.

                        Fishing-effort data for the bycatch calculations were divided into
                        three categories: a portion represented by observer data, an
                        unrepresented portion that could be estimated by extrapolation of
                        sampled data, and an unrepresented portion that could not be
                        estimated. The observers reported a catch of 79 salmonids in 57
                        monitored operations (4% of total fishing effort). For the estimated
                        portion (81% of total fishing effort), a bycatch estimator based on
                        an extension of Aitchison's delta distribution produced a bycatch
                        estimate of 2,648 salmonids. Although the unestimated portion of
                        Japanese fishing effort is small, salmonid bycatches there may have
                        been significant; a Republic of Korea research vessel operating in
                        an unsampled portion of the fishing area and using 37 tans of
                        driftnet caught 13 salmonids. This represents over 16% of the total
                        salmon observed in 1,427,225 tans through the monitoring
                        program.

                        The problem of unestimated strata may be unique to migratory
                        species like salmonids which are found only within a small portion
                        of the total fishing area. In addition, the warm ocean conditions of
                        1989 probably displaced salmonids northward, restricting the
                        amount of fishing area intersecting salmonid waters, and inducing
                        some of the estimation problems associated with our data.</abstract>
