      <abstract>Data obtained during the Bering Sea Cruise, 11 - 26 June 1997

Solar radiation. We measured solar radiation almost continuously in seven wavebands between 411 and 700 nm,
including the wavebands corresponding to the SeaWiFS sensor. Data have been converted to records of
photosynthetically available radiation, useful for biological models. Information on changes in spectral composition of
solar irradiance with time of day and cloud cover will be very useful for interpreting data from the drifters: ocean color
measurements can then be corrected for changes in the spectrum of sunlight.

Upwelling radiance. A tethered radiometer buoy was used to measure upwelling radiance (Lu(l), W m-2 nm-1 sr-1) and
downwelling solar irradiance (Ed(l), W m-2 nm-1) in 13 wavebands between 323 and 700 nm. We have results for 80
5-min intervals during which surface chlorophyll was measured and samples were taken for measurement of spectral
absorption by particulates and dissolved organic matter (DOM). The data are appropriate for developing algorithms for
estimating chlorophyll and DOM from ocean color as measured by the drifters, moorings, aircraft, or (if it is ever clear)
satellites. Solar-stimulated chlorophyll fluorescence (signal at 683 nm) was measured by the radiometer, and algorithms
will be developed. Measurements in UV wavelengths will be useful for future projects.

Reflectance spectra (Lu(l)/Ed(l)) from the cruise show clearly
the biologically-determined optical variability associated with
the eddy. In this plot, data from entire deployments of the
radiometer buoy are described with medians and quartiles.

Absorption by Phytoplankton (strong between ca. 400 - 500
nm) reduces reflectance in the blue. Decreases in blue
reflectance indicate increases in chlorophyll concentration, as
do increases in the fluorescence signal at 683 nm. We see
blue water to the west of the eddy, high-chlorophyll waters
near the edges, and lower-chlorophyll water near the middle.

Chlorophyll a. We measured the concentration of chlorophyll a
fluorometrically in triplicate for more than 275 samples, and
the data are available for distribution. Some samples were
also frozen for parallel determination in the lab using
fluorometric methods and HPLC. Generally, we sampled with a
bucket during radiometer deployments (depth = 0) and also
from 4 depths sampled with the corresponding CTD. We
sampled oligotrophic and mesotrophic waters with good
coverage, and also some bloom waters.

Penetration of spectral irradiance. During most deployments of
the tethered radiometer, we used a free-falling multichannel profiling radiometer to measure downwelling irradiance in 12
wavebands, including those of the SeaWiFS sensors. High-quality data were obtained, which will allow us to calculate
diffuse attenuation coefficients for each waveband as functions of depth for each profile. We will report diffuse
attenuation coefficients at 490 nm and relate these coefficients quantitatively to upwelling radiance ratios.

Ancillary measurements. Richard Davis coordinated this field effort and he, Sophie Johannessen and Jean-Paul Parkhill
(Dalhousie) contributed substantially. Sophie and Jean-Paul also conducted research for their doctoral theses. Sophie
collected samples for the determination of absorption coefficients for the dissolved fraction and also for photochemical
characterization in the lab. Jean-Paul used fluorescence techniques to explore physiological characteristics of
Phytoplankton in different nutrient regimes.</abstract>
      <purpose>Our objective was to use measurements of near-surface optical properties to determine and compare the mean
concentrations and temporal variability of surface chlorophyll within and outside at least one mesoscale eddy in the SE
Bering Sea. This variability was to be related to the relevant physics associated with the eddy. During operations in the
Bering Sea, 11 - 26 June 1997, we collected the necessary measurements of biological and optical properties of surface
waters. The hydrographic field was described by Phyllis Stabeno and colleagues and a persistent eddy was well
characterized. Six drifting radiometers were deployed in or near the eddy, and measurements of position, temperature,
and ocean color have been received throughout the summer. As of September 1997, much of the data from the cruise,
and available data from the drifters have been tabulated and examined. Indications are that the we have the information
we need to achieve our objectives. Additional data from two moorings on the SE Bering Sea Shelf will be analyzed when
they become available.</purpose>
