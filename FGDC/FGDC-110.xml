      <abstract>The 1992 Alaska Fisheries Science Center West Coast triennial
                        bottom trawl survey was conducted to assess stocks of Groundfish
                        inhabiting the continental shelf waters off the coasts of California,
                        Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. This was the sixth
                        survey in an ongoing series to monitor long-term trends in the
                        distribution and abundance of these Groundfish populations.

                        The objectives of the 1992 survey were similar to those of the
                        1989 survey; however, the survey design shifted emphasis away
                        from estimating rockfish abundance, as had been the case in the
                        early surveys (1977, 1980, 1983, and 1986), and instead
                        emphasized assessing a broader range of groundfish species. The
                        design also focused upon precisely estimating the near-bottom
                        component of the Pacific hake (Merluccius productus) and
                        juvenile, (age 1+) sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) resource. The
                        survey encompassed the coastal waters from Pt. Conception,
                        California, to central Vancouver Island, British Columbia (34°30'
                        - 49°40'N lat.), between the depths of 55 and 366 m. A total of
                        569 stations were occupied, of which 501 were successfully
                        sampled. Catches included 135 different species.

                        Survey design and the methods used are described, the data
                        collected are summarized, and the results of analyses of
                        distribution, abundance, and biological parameters are presented.
                        Data on water temperature, catch composition, relative
                        abundance, and geographic distribution are reported. Estimates of
                        biomass, population abundance, and length composition are also
                        presented. Data appendices are located in a separate companion
                        volume.</abstract>
