      <abstract>An advective model was used to simulate the drift of larval walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) over a 40-day period (late April
through early June) near Shelikof Strait, Alaska. This model was used: (i) to assess how much of the observed change in larval positions
during that period can be explained by transport at fixed depth; (ii) to demonstrate that observed change can be related to mean
large-scale meteorological forcing; and (iii) to investigate accumulation of larvae in specific areas near the coast. Based on availability of
larval and circulation data, three years were studied: 1988, 1989 and 1991. Velocity fields generated from a hydrodynamic model driven
by winds and runoff were used to advect particles seeded in accordance with observed larval distributions in late April of each year. The
modelled larvae were tracked at 40 m depth, corresponding to the mean depth of sampled larvae and the depth of neutrally buoyant
drifters employed in field studies. Specific features observed in late May larval surveys were reproduced by the model, such as the
accumulation of larvae in a shoal area downstream of the strait. Differences among the modelled years include extensive flushing of larvae
to the south-west in 1988 and 1991, vs. limited flushing in 1989. These differences appear related to the mean large-scale atmospheric
pressure patterns for April-May of those years.</abstract>
