      <abstract>The Alaska Fisheries Science Center has conducted an annual
                        longline survey of sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) and other
                        Groundfish in the Gulf of Alaska since 1987. This survey replicates
                        as closely as practical the Gulf of Alaska portion of a Japan-U.S.
                        cooperative longline survey conducted from 1979 to 1994 and
                        also samples gullies not sampled during the cooperative longline
                        survey. In 1989, 73 stations were sampled from 26 June to 12
                        September. Each day, 16 km of groundline containing 7,200
                        hooks baited with squid was set from the chartered fishing vessel
                        Ocean Prowler.

                        Sablefish relative population numbers (RPN) on the upper
                        continental slope decreased significantly: 18% from 1988 to 1989.
                        Most of the decrease was observed in the western and central
                        areas of the Gulf of Alaska; the RPN remained about the same in
                        the eastern areas. The strong 1984 year class expected to recruit
                        in 1989 was not apparent in the survey results, nor was there
                        evidence for later strong year classes. The rougheye (Sebastes
                        aleutianus) and shortraker (S. borealis) rockfish RPN increased
                        35% from 1988 to 1989; this increase was not statistically
                        significant. The thornyhead (Sebastolobus alascanus) RPN
                        increased significantly (77%).</abstract>
