      <abstract>Variations in mean stomach content weights (as percentage of
                        body weight) of walleye Pollock, Theragra chalcogramma,
                        collected in the eastern Bering Sea from 1981 to 1987 were
                        analyzed. The results of a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
                        showed that bottom depth and prey type explained the highest
                        proportions of the total variation in stomach content weights (5.7%
                        and 4.6%, respectively), followed by season and year with 3.8%
                        and 2.8% of the total variation, respectively. Time of day and
                        predator length were not important factors. They explained only
                        1% and 0.04% of the total variation, respectively.

                        In general, the mean stomach content weights were low in the
                        continental slope area and high in the continental shelf area.
                        Because this phenomenon does not reflect the abundance of
                        Zooplankton, and because the percentage of empty stomachs
                        increases as the bottom depth increases, it is suggested that
                        undetected regurgitation played an important role in the variation
                        of the stomach content weights.

                        Walleye Pollock that ate both fish and invertebrates had
                        significantly higher stomach content weights than those that ate
                        only invertebrates. Prey type or size, therefore, is probably one of
                        the determinants of the gastric evacuation rate.</abstract>
