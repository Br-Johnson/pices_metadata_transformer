      <abstract>Whale hunters once called them the right whale, because they were large, slow-moving and floated after death. So "right" were these whales that hunters succeeded in driving the species to near extinction by early in the last century. Today, right whales in waters of both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans are among the world's most critically endangered species. In the Bering Sea, off Alaska, scientists say less than three dozen northern Pacific right whales cling to existence. As Doug Schneider reports in this week's Arctic Science Journeys Radio, researchers have begun listening in on their undersea calls, in the hope they might help Alaska's right whales recover.</abstract>
      <purpose>This mournful call is of a northern right whale recorded just last summer in Alaska's Bering Sea. With less than 50 individuals left in the wild, Alaska's right whales are among the world's most endangered species. Lisa Munger is a graduate student at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California. She says the call is of a right whale looking for others of its own kind.</purpose>
